The theme system was introduced in WordPress 1.5. Prior to the introduction of themes, WordPress users could only style their website using a CSS file. There were a number of templating systems already around, and [Matt checked out lots of them.] (http://wordpress.org/news/2003/04/template-engines-uncut/) Donnacha even [imported the Smarty templating system](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/530) but it was decided that Smarty was too complex for WordPress users. 

Using a PHP template tag system had the advantage of being fast and easy, particularly for WordPress developers and designers who were learning about PHP. It was “cheap and easy, and well-known and portable,” says Ryan.  The theme system broke a theme down into its component parts - header, footer, sidebar, for example - theme designers could customize each of the component parts and then use template tags to call different elements to display on the front end. This gave designers a flexible templating system without having to learn something new, such as Smarty.

When WordPress 1.5 was released, it finally gave people a way to easily customize the design of their WordPress website. Many designers loved it, though the road to releasing 1.5 wasn’t always smooth. 

There was a major rupture in the community over the decision to use an adapted version of Michael Heilemann’s Kubrick theme as the default theme. There were complaints, for example, that Kubrick contained image which required the user to use an external image editor to make changes. The thread on the forums reaches five pages with flames thrown all over the place.  https://wordpress.org/support/topic/why-using-kubrick-on-13-is-a-mistake. On his blog, [Matt tried to explain](http://ma.tt/2004/08/trouble/) that Kubrick itself wasn’t being bundled with WordPress, but that the design for Kubrick would be used as the basis for the new default theme.  

That brief explosion around the inclusion of Kubrick was just a taste of the controversy that would surround themes. Throughout WordPress’ history, themes have been divisive, moreso than plugins. Perhaps this is because people were so concerned about how their site looked on the front end - everyone wants a website that looks great and WordPress themes make that easy.

But it wasn’t theme design or development that caused continuing controversy. It was in themes that the community took its first steps towards making money out of WordPress; it’s on that intersection of open source and business that the world tends to get a little fractious. How can community members make money out of an open source project in a way that doesn’t undermine the project? Is making money commensurate with a project whose core ethos is based on the GPL?  Who has the right to make money out of a project that belongs to all of its volunteers? This chapter will look at these issues, and at the various battlegrounds on which issues of commercialisation, licensing, and distribution were fought.

The first of the battles around themes happened around theme sponsorship. Often a designer would include a credit link in their theme, usually linking back to their own site. But people soon caught on that these links had an intrinsic value. Every site that installed the theme meant a link back to the designer’s website. The number of incoming links to a website is a variable in Google’s PageRank algorithm; the more incoming links, the higher the Page Rank, the further up in Google’s search engine results. If hundreds, or even thousands, of people installed a theme, the designer could see themselves soar up Google’s search results. Even better if that link came from a high authority website. The link, however, didn’t necessarily have to be to the original designer’s website. The link could link to anything at all. Designers soon caught on that they could make money by selling the link on their website. Internet Marketers didn’t have to approach individual sites to ask them for a link back - all they had to do was pay a web designer to put it on their theme, release the theme for free, and soon hundreds of sites would be linking back. 

For many it started out as a means of supporting their ability to distribute themes for free, but with WordPress growing in popularity it was becoming a problem. By 2007, WordPress was [stats on growth of WordPress]. 

Theme sponsorship happened in a number of different ways. Sometimes companies would buy links by getting in touch with well-known theme authors to ask if they would sell the links in their themes. Theme authors themselves were also pro-active. Some authors [set up websites where they would advertise and sell their themes](http://themey.com/), others would [auction the theme at Digital Point](https://forums.digitalpoint.com/threads/for-sale-pirates-of-the-caribbean-wordpress-theme-coded.284382/), or simply auction the links. Once the sale had been made, the theme would be promoted on lots of different WordPress theme sites, including official sites such as the WordPress Codex and the WordPress theme viewer, and reputable blogs such as Weblog Tools Collection. These themes were often distributed with a [Creative Commons 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) license, which permits free sharing and adaptation of the theme, provided the credit link remains. 

Websites focused on making money on the web talked about theme sponsorship as an [effective way to make money online](https://web.archive.org/web/20070306065553/http://www.doshdosh.com/link-building-and-seo/link-building-with-word-press-theme-sponsorship-a-good-idea/). 

Theme authors who carried out theme sponsorship usually fell into a number of different categories: some published themes with visible text links but didn’t tell their users about the link, others used PHP or CSS to hide the links, others still made it clear that the theme had been sponsored. 

For [those who were in favour of theme sponsorship](https://web.archive.org/web/20130524074921/http://www.headsetoptions.org/2007/04/09/the-other-point-of-view-%E2%80%93-a-designers-opinion-on-sponsored-themes/), the matter was a simple one of being paid in return for work carried out. They shouldn’t, they argued, be expected to create WordPress themes for free. Why shouldn’t they be compensated for the work that they had done? Selling sponsored links was a way of ensuring that they could create and distribute themes for free, which benefited the whole system. They argued that designing a good theme takes time, maintaining that free themes were inevitably of a poorer quality that sponsored themes. With even respected source [selling links in their themes](http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2007/04/03/wordpress-theme-release-insense/) the problem was endemic. It was seen by many as a [great business model](http://www.blogherald.com/2007/04/06/sponsored-wordpress-themes-a-great-business-model/); finally a way to make money from WordPress! Besides, they argued that the default WordPress blogroll contained links to all of the original developers of WordPress - Alex, Donncha, Dougal, Michel, Matt, Mike, and Ryan - all of whom were benefiting in Google’s search results. 

the argument by those against sponsored themes, was that themes.wordpress.net was becoming a [repository for spam](https://web.archive.org/web/20070409100127/http://blogdesignsolutions.com/2007/03/31/wordpress-theme-sponsorship/). [More than 50% of themes](https://web.archive.org/web/20070417004542/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/04/05/deteriorating-community) on the WordPress Theme Viewer were sponsored themes. These contained links for everything from iPhone repairs to gambling websites, from web hosting to flower delivery. Some themes would be uploaded multiple times with only minor changes to the theme, thereby increasing the number of links on the theme viewer. This increase in spam in a resource for WordPress users was deteriorating the WordPress community. Many of those critical of theme sponsorship were theme designers themselves. They weren’t against theme designers making money, but they didn’t want to see the WordPress community become a hive of spam and shady SEO techniques. Besides, Matt argued, [plugin authors didn’t include credit links](http://ma.tt/2007/04/plugin-authors-get-no-love/) and the plugin ecosystem was thriving.

The issue of buying and selling links went well beyond the WordPress community. A few years earlier, Matt Cutts, the head of web spam at Google, posted on his blog about how  [link selling affected PageRank](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/text-links-and-pagerank/). Google’s algorithm detected paid links, and while it wasn’t foolproof it worked pretty well. The problem was that it made it harder for Google to determine the trustworthiness of a website: > Reputable sites that sell links won’t have their search engine rankings or PageRank penalized–a search for [daily cal] would still return dailycal.org. However, link-selling sites can lose their ability to give reputation (e.g. PageRank and anchortext). Users were in a position that their site could be penalised for links that they weren’t even aware that they were hosting on their website. Hidden links could have an even more detrimental effect on a user’s PageRank. In a post in April 2007, Matt Cutts condemned the practice of [hiding links in a website](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/hidden-links/) and asked web masters to make a full disclosure about paid links on their websites.

However, there were plenty of themes around that contained links that weren’t sponsored.  There were plenty of designers who [included a credit link in their footer](https://web.archive.org/web/20080104150212/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/04/11/design-credit-ramblings-again/) linking back to their own website. Designing and releasing a WordPress theme was a way for many designers to increase their profile on the web. Like the internet marketers, their websites would benefit from higher search engine results, and website visitors might click on the link, sending business to the designer. 

Many designers released their themes under a creative commons license, with the only restriction being that the user leave the credit link in tact. In the middle of the furore about sponsored links, however, one designer took the next step. Tung Do, [tungdo](http://profiles.wordpress.org/tungdo) was the author of popular WordPress resource WPDesigner.com as well as a number of popular WordPress themes. In April, he announced that he was [releasing all of his themes under the GPL](https://web.archive.org/web/20080113192235/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/04/10/switching-from-creative-commons-to-gpl/) "Despite that I’m just ONE theme designer and despite that I don’t contribute directly the WordPress codes,” he wrote, “I believe that switching to GPL is a step in the direction to support the WordPress team and to help the WordPress theme community grow (positively).” 

One of the first websites to take direct action against sponsored themes was Weblog Tools Collection (WLTC). WLTC was a popular blog which regularly posted about theme releases. Theme authors could submit a theme and Mark regularly posted about [new theme releases](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/20/wordpress-theme-releases-for-0420/). In April, Mark weighed in on the issue of sponsored themes. While he didn’t condemn them outright, he did instate a new policy: > In that spirit, all themes with sponsorship links will be labelled as such when they are published, non-sponsored themes will be published first and we require sponsorship disclosure to be made to us when authors make us aware of their new themes. If this disclosure is not provided and the theme has sponsored links, the author will be barred from being able to post their new themes on weblogtoolscollection.com until further notice. The [166 comments in the comment thread](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/09/sponsored-themes/#comments) highlighted just how divisive the issue was.

A few days later, Matt followed Mark’s lead and [himself posted on WLTC about the issue of sponsored themes](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/12/on-sponsored-themes/). He had himself [become aware of the trend of including advertising links in themes](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-September/008293.html) back in September 2006 when he had downloaded the Barthelme theme from plaintxt.org and it contained a link to  New York flower delivery service.  For him, the issue came down to three main issues: - that sponsored links could negatively impact a user’s Trustrank and that the user hadn’t made this decision themselves, the theme author/sponsor was making it for them; - that theme sponsorship simply constituted adware; - that theme authors who sell links and release it under a creative commons license were on shaky licensing grounds themselves. The major battles around theme licensing and the GPL were yet to come, but even then the position of the project was that themes link with the internal functions and data structures of WordPress and therefore inherit the license. Besides, the argument that theme authors deserved to be compensated for their work held little weight when WordPress itself had been built by volunteers for free. There was no opposition from the project that people make money from WordPress, but official WordPress resources should only promote companies and individuals that did so in a way that was in line with the ethics of the project.

Matt closed the post by [opening voting on WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/ideas/topic/remove-sponsored-themes-from-wordpressorg) on a proposal to remove sponsored themes from WordPress.org. The discussion on the thread has arguments for and against theme sponsorship throughout; some voted for a complete ban, others for sponsored themes simply to be disclosed, while others felt that it was a theme designers prerogative to include whatever links that they wanted in their theme.

It was clear, however, that whatever the results of the vote, sponsored themes would not be looked upon favourably at WordPress.org, with sites and persons promoting sponsored themes already [banned from the WordPress.org forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-theme-hockey). And the tide was turning against sponsored themes, with Matt Cutts posting on his blog that he [agreed 100% with Matt’s position on sponsored themes](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/by-the-way-2/).

In July, Mark announced on WLTC that he [would no longer post about sponsored themes](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/07/10/no-sponsored-themes-on-weblogtoolscollection/) and shortly after [Matt announced that all sponsored themes would be removed from themes.WordPress.net](http://ma.tt/2007/07/wltc-high-ground/). The response from the WordPress community was largely positive, but there was a backlash, directed particularly towards [Mark](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/07/16/turning-the-other-cheek/) and [Matt](http://ma.tt/2007/07/love-and-hate/).

There were lots of theme developers who saw theme sponsorship as a valid way of making money, and [who were frustrated by being tarnished as “unethical”](https://web.archive.org/web/20130523083509/http://www.mandarinmusing.com/2007/07/14/if-i-could-walk-on-water-you%E2%80%99d-complain-i-can%E2%80%99t-swim/), particularly when they saw other theme developers acting in other ways that were unethical; [down voting other developer’s themes and employing sock puppetry to up vote their own](https://web.archive.org/web/20130313072629/http://www.mandarinmusing.com/2007/03/02/wordpress-rating-scams-and-new-releases-march-2nd-2007/), for example, or stuffing themes with huge numbers of links to their own website.

In the aftermath, two prominent advocates for theme sponsorship [revealed that they had been the moderators on themes.wordpress.net](https://web.archive.org/web/20130426221936/http://www.headsetoptions.org/2007/07/14/matt-takes-over-httpthemeswordpressnet/). For them, there were more pressing problems in the WordPress community; issues around the GPL, licensing, and copyright, issues that wouldn’t be properly addressed until two years later, coming to head in one of the biggest ruptures in the history of WordPress.

Despite the banning of sponsored themes on official WordPress resources, the practice of selling links continues today. The digital point forums, for example, are filled with [themes available for sponsorship](https://forums.digitalpoint.com/forums/template-sponsorship.128/). The practice of theme sponsorship, however, is not without its pitfalls. In 2012, a former theme sponsor [posted on the Webmaster world forums](http://www.webmasterworld.com/google/4445558.htm). He is being penalised by Google for incoming links that are “inorganic”: > Some 2+ years ago in throws of questionable wisdom I sponsored about 5 or 6 WordPress themes where the "Designed by" link in the footer gets replaced by a link to your site. They were nice looking and "relevant" themes, at least as far as the name and pictures used in design suggest. They were not used much initially and I did not think much of them until these "unnatural links" notices started flying a month ago. Google confirmed that these links were the issue, but with the themes in the wild there wasn’t a whole lot that the sponsor could do about it other than contact the websites using the theme and asking them to remove the link. 

In the aftermath of the furore around sponsored themes, designers and developers started to look for new ways to make money out of WordPress themes. While the removal of sponsored themes from official WordPress resources cleared spam from the community it had an unintended consequence. Sponsored themes were one of the first ways that large amounts of people tried to make money out of WordPress themes. There were people doing custom design and development, but selling links in themes seemed like a valid way of making money. This at a time on the internet when there was growth in the number of SEO experts and internet marketers who were on an unremitting search for ways to climb Google’s search results. Sponsored themes were at the intersection between WordPress and SEO, an intersection that Matt knew well after his experience with Hot Nacho. It was too easy for selling links in a theme to slide into questionable SEO practices. Besides, it wasn’t a business model that was sustainable. With Google the rule-makers, a simple rule change could wipe out an entire market.

When the project removed all sponsored themes from official resources the message became mixed in the process. “WordPress doesn’t support sponsored themes” became “WordPress doesn’t want me to make money” and so when theme designers started to sell their themes there was already an element of antagonism. Some designers felt that Matt only wanted Automattic to make money from WordPress, and there were times when the attitude in the community verged on conspiratorial. The situation wasn’t helped when, later in 2007, [Matt announced a WordPress.com theme marketplace](http://ma.tt/2007/11/wpcom-marketplace-idea/), resulting in [cries about hypocrisy](http://www.blogherald.com/2007/11/01/wordpress-theme-marketplace-hypocrisy-from-matt/).  But in all of the wrangling around themes and all of the questions that were asked around licensing, distribution, and copyright, the community was able to reach a point of stability. Before it could get there, though, everyone had to to go through something of an education.

Designers had been releasing WordPress themes for free from the release of WordPress 1.5 onwards. Even before that, it was possible to find CSS stylesheets with which to quickly change the look of your blog (many of which were created for Alex King’s CSS Stylesheet competition). But with the failure of sponsored themes, community members wanted to find out a new way of making money.

The word “premium” already implies something that is superior, that there was something that set these themes apart from free (and inferior) themes. The implication follows that there was something lacking in free themes - whether in design or functionality - and if users wanted that special something they were going to have to pay for it. But what was [different about premium themes](https://web.archive.org/web/20080121035631/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/09/21/what-makes-a-premium-wordpress-theme/), other than the price tag?

It often seemed that the community wasn’t quite sure what made a theme premium. When the question “[What makes a WordPress Theme Premium](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/12/what-makes-a-wordpress-theme-premium/)” was asked on WeblogToolsCollection [there was a large range of responses](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/12/what-makes-a-wordpress-theme-premium/#comments) that included: better documentation and support, less bloggy, better design, better features, better code, more functionality. Or, at least, that’s what community members felt that premium themes should include. A substantial number of community members pointed out that the only difference between free and premium themes was money.

Whatever the feeling in the community, developers who were making both free and premium themes distinguished between them according to the time and effort they put into them, and the level of effort required to set them up. In [an interview in June 2008](http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/wordpress/free-vs-premium/), premium theme developer Darren Hoyt shared the difference between creating a free and a premium theme. He outlines the following considerations for him as a developer: - that hand-coding and tweaks to the files should be minimised for the user. As a result he created a custom control panel. - as a developer he didn’t feel that users should have to download additional functionality so all of the functionality for the theme was bundled with it. “We tried to make Mimbo Pro more than just a theme or “skin” and more like an application unto itself.” - that best practices with regards to commenting code, valid markup, and well-written CSS be followed. - that documentation be provided and evolve. - that buyers get ongoing support and interactions with the developer.

An interview in March 2008 with Revolution theme designer, Brian Gardner is telling. For him, it was all about how the site looks and acts. When asked what made a theme premium he answered “if people respond to a site and say "wow, I can't believe WordPress is behind that," that's what premium themes are all about."

Not everyone thought that selling themes was a good business to be in.  Shortly after launch showcase, Tung Do announced his decision to release [free premium themes](https://web.archive.org/web/20071101035329/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/09/25/good-news-for-wpdesigner/); he was paying for the designer and coding the themes himself.

Although sites like Template Monster sold WordPress themes as early as 2006, it wasn’t until 2007 that designers within the WordPress community started to sell them themselves. The last quarter of 2007 saw the first surge in WordPress premium theme releases. August 2007 saw [Revolution](https://web.archive.org/web/20070825022722/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/the-revolution-begins.htm) from Brian Gardner which one of the first premium WordPress themes, and a few weeks later Tung Do released [Showcase](https://web.archive.org/web/20071016132417/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/09/10/showcase/). Later that year saw [Proximity](http://www.nathanrice.net/blog/premium-wordpress-themes/) from Nathan Rice, Charity Ondriezek’s [Cornerstone Theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20080106173642/http://designadaptations.com/notebook/a-cornerstone-to-build-from/#comment-2836), Adii Pienaar’s [Premium News Theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20071106033124/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/11/02/the-launch-of-premium-news-theme), and early the following year [Thesis](http://www.pearsonified.com/2008/03/diy-themes-pre-launch.php), from Chris Pearson.

Many of these so-called premium theme sellers had started out authoring free WordPress themes, had built up a following, and decided to see if they could make money out of their hobby. They weren’t looking to make a career out of theming, it was just something they did to make money in their spare time, for example, or as a side project while studying at university. Many of them were also doing independent development for clients at the same time. 

It was clear from the outset, that [theme sellers themselves](https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045548/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/how-much-would-you-pay-for-a-premium-theme.htm) were not quite sure how to price and license their themes. At that time, there wasn’t yet a consensus in the community about how themes should be licensed and there was nothing concrete from the WordPress project either. It was clear that the project preferred that themes be GPL, but there was no concrete stipulation. As a result, theme authors tended to create their own license. A common approach was that a user would either by a single-use license to use the theme on one website, and if they wanted to use it on more websites they could buy more licenses or a bulk or developer license. As well as restrictions on use, the licenses also restricted what the user could do with the theme.  They sometimes, for example, had a requirement that the user had to retain the author credit in the theme, enabling the authors [to charge for removal of the attribution link](http://diythemes.com/thesis/remove-attribution-link/).

The response from the community varied widely between users, developers, and other community members. The [interview with Brian Gardner](https://web.archive.org/web/20080427183149/http://www.revolutionizeyourblog.com/askthanks.php) of Revolution is illuminating because the interviewer is a keen Revolution advocate and it’s clear from his enthusiasm what he gets from a premium theme: guaranteed support, comfort, safety, and the feeling like they are being looked after. Of course, a price tag didn’t necessarily equate to these things, but some premium theme developers were doing a good job of looking after their customers. With WordPress growing in popularity, it was no longer confined to the world of personal blogging. Businesses, particularly small businesses, were using WordPress to build their website. Paying a small fee for peace of mind would have seemed like a worthwhile trade-off. When you pay money for a theme you expect to get support. A free theme comes with no guarantees.

Not all theme developers were selling premium themes. Many theme developers were frustrated by premium theme sellers. “ ‘Premium’, when it comes to WordPress themes,” [writes Ian Stewart in a blog post in 2008](http://themeshaper.com/2008/02/28/the-future-of-premium-wordpress-themes/), “simply means ‘it costs money’ and not ‘of superior quality’.” There was nothing that made premium themes inherently better than free ones. In fact, Justin Tadlock had proved that there was [nothing to stop a developer from releasing a fully-featured bells and whistles theme](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/02/24/options-wordpress-theme) for free. He went further a few months later by [posting about his own theme club](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/05/31/project-m). In contrast to theme sales, he wanted to create a community around theme releases and support. Later that year he [launched theme hybrid](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/08/05/wordpress-theme-club-launch).

What wasn’t clear to the wider community was that it wasn’t simply a black and white matter. Many people thought that they could either be involved with the community, or make money out of selling themes or plugins. A wp-hackers thread from March 2008 [asks for feedback on the premium theme concept](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018694.html). The original poster, Glenn Ansley, [says](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018730.html) “I guess it all goes back to what one's primary goal for developing under the WP platform is: money or contribution to the community.” Mark Jaquith, however, [was quick to point out](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018792.html) that the situation wasn’t black and white. It was possible to make money with WordPress while still making a positive contribution to the project. Business and open source didn’t have to be either/or - it works best when symbiotic. 

In the same thread, Matt outlined how he saw businesses best interacting with the WordPress community: 
> A GPL software community is like the environment. Yes you could make  profit building widgets in your widget factory and not pay any heed to the forests you're clearing or the rivers your polluting, but in a few  years you're going to start to deplete the commons, and your business and public perception will be in peril. […]
> Contrast that with sustainable development, with giving back to the community that sustains (and ultimately consumes) your services and you have the makings of something that could be around for generations to come.

At that time, however, he didn’t see the premium theme market as commensurate with the community. He [described premium theme sellers as being in](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018780.html) “murky waters” and pointed out that there wasn’t much money in the enterprise.  In [a conversation with Ptah Dunbar](https://web.archive.org/web/20090625070845/http://ptahdunbar.com/news/wp-news-theme-update-and-matt-mullenwegs-views-on-premium-wordpress-themes), he said that he didn’t like were premium WordPress themes were going, that the premium theme market wasn’t helping the community to grow.  

[figures on the growth of premium themes]

Much of the early discussions and debates were around whether someone should or should not be making money from WordPress. It wasn’t until later that a more subtle and nuanced debate started happening: under what licensing terms should themes be distributed? WordPress itself is licensed under the GPL; the GPL’s distribution terms ensure that the distributions and modifications of the program carry the same license. This also applies to derivative works, which is where all of the contention lay: is a theme derivative of WordPress? There were arguments for and against on both sides but often the arguments fell into speculation and opinion, much of which was based on interpretations (or second-hand interpretations) of the license. No one had fought a court case around the GPL so there had no been any official ruling to refer to. There was arguments, debates, and misinformation, but the community came down into two camps - those who thought themes didn’t have to be GPL, and those who thought they did.

The argument was based on whether WordPress with a theme was an aggregation or a combination. The FAQ for the GPL [distinguishes between the two](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#MereAggregation): an aggregate means putting two programs side by side (like on a hard disc or a CD-ROM).  Those who said that themes didn’t have to be GPL, said that WordPress + theme was an aggregate. A theme modified the output of WordPress, but didn’t engage with its internals. WordPress core developers, however, stated again and again [that themes use WordPress core internals](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/theme-licensing?replies=22#post-543507). For a theme to be completely independent it would need to use none of WordPress internal functions. 

When the debate within the community came to a head in 2010, Mark Jaquith wrote a post [outlining why themes are derivative of WordPress](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/). He writes: > It isn’t correct to think of WordPress and a theme as separate entities. As far as the code is concerned, they form one functional unit. The theme code doesn’t sit “on top of” WordPress. It is within it, in multiple different places, with multiple interdependencies. This forms a web of shared data structures and code all contained within a shared memory space.

[Linking]

For those who accepted that the PHP was linked with WordPress in such a way that the theme inherited the GPL, there was still another possibility: a split license or, [what Matt memorably called](http://themeshaper.com/2008/09/08/the-ethics-of-premium-wordpress-themes/comment-page-1/#comment-8843, packaging gymnastics. While the PHP in a WordPress theme does work with WordPress internal functions, the CSS, Javascript, and images, do not. Therefore, a theme developer could package their theme with two licenses, one for the PHP and one for the other files. For theme authors concerned about piracy and copyright this protected their intellectual property while ensuring they followed the letter of the GPL. For the project, however, this was simply an evasive game that did an injustice to the spirit of the GPL, i.e. that software users be free to do what they want with the software.

A major concern for theme authors was piracy. They didn’t like the fact that someone could buy their theme and legally distribute it, or sell it. After the sponsored themes debacle, community members were looking for ways to sell products rather than services. It’s move obvious how you can scale a business selling products than with services. After all, it’s possible to sell a digital product ad infinitum, creating a relatively passive income for yourself. Doing custom design or development for clients is restrained by time and resources.

Putting a proprietary license on a theme, however, didn’t stop piracy. Themes from commercial sellers were cropping up on torrent sites all over the web and [being sold on forums such as Digital Point for a cut price](https://web.archive.org/web/20080915174028/http://www.adii.co.za/2008/02/17/pirated-wordpress-themes-get-a-100-theme-for-only-6/). It was easy, if a user wanted, to download a commercial theme for free (though often it came loaded with additional links and malware). 

What became obvious, however, was that people who were buying themes weren’t simply interested in the product. They were happy to pay a premium for the services around a product, like support and documentation, for example. 

Other concerns were around making money. How could a business make money selling a product that gave the buyer the right to give it away, or even sell it, themselves? With selling theme links out the door after sponsored themes were removed from the WordPress theme repo, it seemed like there were two ways to make money: customisation or products. Designers and developers were reluctant distribute with a license that they thought would damage their business.

[section on revolution going GPL]

Things were finally brought to a head just before Christmas 2008 when, without warning,[ 200 themes were pulled from the WordPress theme repository](https://web.archive.org/web/20090212220653/http://spectacu.la/wordpressorg-pull-200-gpl-themes). This didn’t just provoke outrage amongst premium theme developers but [amongst the wider community](https://web.archive.org/web/20090315162659/http://www.jeffro2pt0.com/why-were-200-wordpress-themes-removed). Many people didn’t see the problem with theme authors selling their themes. Again, people conflated the actions of WordPress.org with Automattic and the company came under fire. The removal of themes from WordPress.org was seen as a sign that Automattic didn’t want them making any money. The rhetoric got nasty. There [were claims](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/12/11/automattic-putting-the-boot-to-premium-theme-developers#comment-68674) that Automattic wanted every theme to be released for free so that the company could get its hands on them. Matt himself was accused of being a hypocrite and [of carrying out a jihad against premium theme sellers](http://www.inquisitr.com/11963/more-hypocrisy-from-mullenweg-and-wordpress-with-new-themes-jihad/).

[Noel Jackson quote]

Beyond the hyperbolic rhetoric, theme sellers weren’t happy. They hadn’t been given any warning that their themes would be pulled from the repository. Many of them released themes as a way of supporting the community and spent considerable time ensuring that their themes made the coding standards of the theme repository.  They felt as though the rug had been pulled from underneath them: they’d done their best to comply with WordPress.org standards but the rules of the game had changed. 

An email from Matt started doing the rounds in the community: 

> Thanks for emailing me about the theme directory. The other day I noticed a ton of bad stuff had snuck in like lots of spammy SEO links, themes whose sites said you couldn’t modify them (which is a violation of the GPL), etc. Exactly the sort of stuff the theme directory was meant to avoid.

> There were also a few that violated WP community guidelines, like the domain policy. So since Monday we’ve been clearing stuff out en mass. If you’re kosher with the GPL and don’t claim or promote otherwise on your site and your theme was removed, it was probably a mistake. Give us a week to catch up with the bad stuff and then drop a note.

> Thanks guys, and let me know if you have any more questions.

However, the email did little to alleviate concerns. For most people, the email didn’t tell them anything and it came across as blasé.

In a [podcast on WeblogToolsCollection](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/12/19/2hr-interview-with-matt-mullenweg/), Matt discussed at length his position on the premium theme market ([transcription](http://www.wpsnippets.com/2008/12/transcript-of-wordpress-weeklys-interview-with-matt-mullenweg-december-2008-part-1/). In the interview, Matt describes how he was updating a friend’s website which led him to start looking for WordPress themes in the directory. When he started looking he found themes with SEO links or linked to SEO sites, the behaviour that the theme directory had been set up to avoid. This led the team at WordPress.org to ask whether they wanted to allow GPL themes in the repository that seemed to serve as advertisements for non-GPL themes elsewhere. Their answer was no. 

In the interview, Matt makes clear that certain distinctions ought to be made. When it comes to “premium” themes, the word “proprietary” makes more sense as it doesn’t make a value judgement that themes that cost money are better than those that don’t. In a discussion about licensing, “proprietary” is more accurate than “commercial” or “premium” to distinguish a theme from a GPL theme, because GPL themes, such as Brian Gardner’s Revolution, can be commercial.

> I love what Revolution has done, where they say ‘Ok, so we still sold the theme, and we still bundle the support and everything like that with it, but it’s also available as GPL.’ So they’re able to, within the GPL framework, create a business and respect the underlying license of the community that they are building on top of.

Most importantly, in the interview he makes it clear that theme developers are free to do what they want on their site, but that the WordPress project is equally free to do what it wants on WordPress.org, and that included whether it should or should not promote non-GPL WordPress products. Part of the aim of the theme and plugin repositories are to promote theme and plugin developers. What the project didn’t want to do was to promote theme and plugin developers who violated WordPress’ license. Therefore, theme sellers who sold non-GPL products outside of WordPress.org would not be promoted on the site.

[add something about failure of communication after talking to Matt]

What the interview did do was calm much of the storm, answering unresolved questions that many people had been asking.

If 2008 was the year in which wars raged around the GPL, 2009 was the year that businesses started to embrace it. In the months following the debate, discussions started happening behind closed doors about how a business could be sustainable with the GPL. As the first to embrace the GPL, Brian Gardner provided advice to other premium theme sellers. In April 2009, [Spectacu.la](https://web.archive.org/web/20090619172730/http://spectacu.la/were-going-100-gpl/), the theme shop that first posted about themes being removed from the repo, was the first to fully GPL his themes. They was followed in June by [iThemes](http://ithemes.com/2009/06/11/ithemes-is-going-gpl/) and and [WooThemes](https://web.archive.org/web/20100309084201/http://www.woothemes.com/2009/06/woothemes-gpled). 

Despite prior resistance [check interview with Adii]

In July, Matt announced that he had been in touch with the Software Freedom Law Centre which [had provided its opinion on theme licensing](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/): > the WordPress themes supplied contain elements that are derivative of WordPress’s copyrighted code. These themes, being collections of distinct works (images, CSS files, PHP files), need not be GPL-licensed as a whole. Rather, the PHP files are subject to the requirements of the GPL while the images and CSS are not. Third-party developers of such themes may apply restrictive copyrights to these elements if they wish.

Following that announcement, more theme sellers followed suit, though not all went fully GPL (including CSS, images, and Javascript). Envato, for example, whose popular marketplace Theme Forest was growing in popularity, opted [for GPL compliance only with a split license](https://web.archive.org/web/20090819130204/http://blog.themeforest.net/site-news/important-change-to-wordpress-license-takes-effect-today-please-read) in which the PHP was GPL but the additional files were proprietary.

There was on popular theme that held out against the GPL. The Thesis Theme from DIYThemes was one of the most popular themes around. It was a theme created by WordPress theme designer Chris Pearson and well-known blogger Brian Clark from Copyblogger. It was a functionality-heavy theme that gave users way more options than they had in most WordPress themes. WordPress users could use the user interface to customise every element of their website. On the original about page [Chris states the aim of thesis](https://web.archive.org/web/20080610074529/http://diythemes.com/thesis/about/): “I wanted a framework that had it all—killer typography, a dynamically resizable layout, intelligent code, airtight optimization, and tons of flexibility.” It was [featured on a number of tech blogs](http://thenextweb.com/2008/07/17/thesis-represents-the-next-generation-of-wordpress-themes/#!A2Baz) and adopted and endorsed by high-profile bloggers such as [Matt Cutts](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/switching-things-around/), [Chris Brogan](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/thesis-wordpress-theme/), and [Darren Rowse](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/18/thesis-a-wordpress-theme-design-worth-considering/).

Chris Pearson himself was well-respected in the community, having already developed Cutline and PressRow before moving into the premium theme market with Thesis. Thesis itself was hugely influential on theme development. A [post from mid-2009 on Theme Shaper talks about](http://themeshaper.com/2009/05/21/design-popular-wordpress-theme-chris-pearsons-secret/) “The Pearson Principle”: “Bloggers want powerfully simple design on an equally robust framework.” With themes such as Revolution and Premium News, theme developers were already moving into creating themes packed with functionality, but Thesis cemented that move. Simple design on the front end with options for full website customisation. It was the era of the theme framework, when a theme framework had as much functionality as WordPress itself and the user was able to create a design to their own liking. [Chris called this](http://themeshaper.com/2009/05/21/design-popular-wordpress-theme-chris-pearsons-secret/comment-page-1/#comment-9718) “ubiquitous design” - a theme was no longer just a website skin but a tool for building your website. It would take another four years before theme developers would stop packing themes with options and start moving functionality into plugins.

Other theme developers started to adopt the GPL, but Thesis held out. Discussions were [happening between DIY Themes and Toni Schneider from Automattic](http://pomomusings.com/2009/06/04/switch-wordpress-blog/#comment-59022) about how the theme could become GPL compliant but no progress seemed to be made. A [later interview with Brian Clark sheds light on much of what was going on](http://technosailor.com/2010/07/29/exclusive-interview-brian-clark-leaves-diythemesthesis-theme/) behind closed doors. Brian Clark had been sent during the summer of 2009 to talk to Automattic CEO Toni Schneider and Matt about Thesis transitioning to a GPL license. After working out the details he returned to Chris who had subsequently changed his mind. 

Relationships were already fractious between WordPress and DIY Themes. In June 2009, as discussions were going on between Brian and Toni, a blogger’s comments thread was [hijacked](http://pomomusings.com/2009/06/04/switch-wordpress-blog/#comment-59022%29) for a long discussion about Thesis and the GPL. Matt’s appearance in the comments and request that “if you care about the philosophical underpinnings of WordPress please consider putting your support behind something that isn’t hostile to WordPress’ core freedoms and GPL license,” are reminiscent of his comments on Movable Type users’ blogs in 2004.

For three weeks in July 2010, the debate between WordPress and Thesis flared up so that all of the major tech news sites took notice. It started with an interview that [Chris Pearson interview on entrepreneur-interview website Mixergy](http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-thesis-interview/). In it Chris is expansive on the revenue generated from Thesis, putting a conservative estimate at 1.2 million dollars within 16 to 18 months.  

Just over a week later an [Matt and Chris took to Twitter.](https://twitter.com/pearsonified/status/18536597161). Cutting remarks were passed back and forth until Andrew Warner from Mixergy decided to get the two men in a virtual room. An [impromptu debate was set up and the issues were debated live](http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-matt-mullenweg/). The hour long discussion lays both sides out on the table. Matt argues that Thesis is built on GPL software, WordPress, and therefore should honour the license. By not doing so, he both disrespects all of the authors of WordPress and breaks the law. For Chris, adopting the GPL means giving up his rights and losing his protection from piracy. He argues that “what I’ve done stands alone outside of WordPress completely”, and that Thesis “does not inherit anything from WordPress.” The argument descends into a rambling discussion of economics, and ends in Matt saying that he’s willing to sue Chris if he’s not willing to comply with the GPL. 

Following the interview, more and more public action was taken against Thesis by Matt, Automattic, and WordPress. Matt [offered to buy Thesis users an alternative premium theme](https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/18548422506), consultants using Thesis were [removed from the Code Poet directory of WordPress consultants](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mg315/4792383313/), and Chris Pearson’s other themes, Cutline and PressRow, were [removed from WordPress.com](http://www.pearsonified.com/2010/11/former-cutline-pressrow-theme-user.php). 

Matt wasn’t the only person involved with WordPress to come out against Thesis. Other lead and core developers took to their own blogs to write about their stance on the GPL and Thesis. [Ryan Boren wrote](http://ryan.boren.me/2010/07/15/wordpress-theme-licensing/), “where do I stand as one of the primary copyright holders of WordPress?  I’d like to see the PHP parts of themes retain the GPL.  Aside from preserving the spirit of WordPress, respecting the open source ecosystem in which it thrives, and avoiding questionable legal ground, retaining the GPL is practical.” Mark Jaquith [wrote about how WordPress themes don’t sit on top of WordPress](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/ but are interdependent with it. A theme is combined WordPress “in multiple different places, with multiple interdependencies. This forms a web of shared data structures and code all contained within a shared memory space. If you followed the code execution for Thesis as it jumped between WordPress core code and Thesis-specific code, you’d get a headache, because you’d be jumping back and forth literally hundreds of times.”

Even developers who didn’t agree that a theme was necessarily derivative of WordPress thought that Thesis itself was derivative. Developer Drew Blas [wrote a script that took every line of WordPress and compared it with Thesis.](http://drewblas.com/2010/07/15/an-analysis-of-gpled-code-in-thesis/) His script pulled up a number of instances of Thesis code that was taken from WordPress. Core developer Andrew Nacin [also pointed out](http://nacin.com/2010/07/15/thesis-gpl/) that Thesis’ own inline documentation read “* This function is mostly copy pasta from WP (wp-includes/media.php), but with minor alteration to play more nicely with our styling.”

Questions about Thesis weren’t just coming from outside DIY Themes. One of their former employees [left a comment on Matt’s blog](http://ma.tt/2010/07/syn-thesis-1/#comment-481845): > check out Thesis’ handling of comments (thesis/lib/classes/comments.php). Large chunks of it are ripped right from WordPress. I know they are… because I’m the one who did the ripping. Whether I informed Chris of that or not doesn’t matter because I no longer have any of our old chat logs to prove one way or another, but suffice it to say the latest public release of Thesis (and numerous versions before hand) contain obviously GPL code. Whether those portions get rewritten in the impending 3.0 release, I don’t know… but for Chris to claim that he was responsible for and devised all of Thesis at 13:33 or so in the debate… Well, he was lying to you, either intentionally or not. (Actually, it’d have to be intentional; he should know that I contributed several important bits of code & features.)

On 22nd July, not even a week after the initial Mixergy interview, [Chris Pearson announced](https://twitter.com/pearsonified/status/19288707443) that Thesis was going to be released with a split license. The public furore compounded by pressure from inside DIY Themes forced Chris to capitulate. The license was drafted by [Brian Clark, who shortly after left DIY Themes,] (http://technosailor.com/2010/07/29/exclusive-interview-brian-clark-leaves-diythemesthesis-theme/) citing “completely different opinions about the direction of the development of Thesis, the running of the company, and our relationship with the WordPress community.”

The debate around Thesis and the GPL had far-reaching implications on everyone involved. [Prominent blogs moved away from Thesis](http://ma.tt/2010/08/syn-thesis-3-switchers/), with Brian Gardner’s Genesis theme being a popular choice. Thesis and Chris Pearson became less prominent in the community, focusing instead on cultivating and building upon his large customer base. It was also made clear to the world that WordPress was prepared to go to court when developers flagrantly abused the license. There was, for a while, a relative calm in the community around the GPL. WordPress.org supported commercial theme sellers whose themes were 100% GPL and tolerated those that had a split license. So when the next argument around the GPL flared up, this time it was about focused on the spirit of the GPL, as opposed to its legality. 

In the interview with Jeff Chandler in 2008, Matt is asked about the spirit of the GPL. The spirit of the GPL, he says, is about user empowerment, about the four freedoms: to use, distribute, modify, and distribute modifications of the software. Software and distributed with these four freedoms attached is done so in the spirit of the GPL. WordPress was created and distributed in this spirit, giving users full freedom with regards to the software. The opinion of the Software Freedom Law Centre, however, gave developers a loophole, one that let them be compliant with the GPL but without giving users the same freedoms as WordPress. The PHP in themes is required to be GPL, but the CSS, images, and Javascript are not. Thus, when Thesis was released with a GPL license it was with a split license - the PHP was GPL, the rest of the code and files were proprietary. This ensures that the theme is GPL compliant but it isn’t released according to the driving ethos of the GPL - that of user freedom.

Theme sellers that sold their themes with a fully GPL license were supported by WordPress. Those that weren’t didn’t get any support or promotion on WordPress.org or on official resources. For some of the major theme sellers, like Thesis, for example, this didn’t have any major impact on their business. 

A major player in the theme market, however, found itself in the eye of a GPL storm in 2013. Envato is the company behind a cluster of blogs and marketplaces that sell everything from WordPress themes and plugins, themes for other CMS, photographs, video, and illustrations. WordPress was just one aspect of their business, though a significant one, and ever growing. Envato had been one of the theme companies to take the step in 2009 to become GPL compliant. Their themes were released with two licenses: GPL for the PHP, and a proprietary license of the rest of the files and code.

Theme Forest has long been a popular choice for individual theme sellers. It offers exposure and access to a huge community of users. With the theme shop marketplace becoming increasing saturated it became more and more difficult for new theme sellers to break through. Theme shops like StudioPress, WooThemes, and Elegant Themes came to dominate the market. Theme Forest offers everything a theme seller needs: hosting, sales tools, commerce, and a shop front. It provides a way for people to sell themes without having to do all of the associated setup work that can take up so much time. Besides, theme sellers were making good money out of selling on Theme Forest. As early as December 2011, Envato [announced its first theme seller to make a million dollars in theme sales](http://notes.envato.com/milestones/kriesi-first-to-1000000-on-the-marketplaces/).

The matter came to a head in January 2013 when Theme Forest author Jake Caputo received an email from Andrea Middleton from WordCamp Central. He was told that because he is an author on Theme Forest that he was not allowed to participate at official WordPress events. The events in question were WordCamps, the volunteer-organised events that are run all over the world. Jake had already spoken at two WordCamps, was planning to speak at a third, and was helping to organise WordCamp Chicago.

The issue was over theme licensing. WordCamps are official WordPress events that come with the seal of approval of the WordPress Foundation. [One of the stipulations](http://plan.wordcamp.org/become-an-organizer/representing-wordpress/) of being an organiser, volunteer, or speaker, is that you embrace the license. This goes beyond compliance and means that you pass on WordPress freedoms to your users. In short, that all of your WordPress-related products are 100% GPL.

> Embrace the WordPress license. If distributing WordPress-derivative works (themes, plugins, WP distros), any person or business should give their users the same freedoms that WordPress itself provides. Note: this is one step above simple compliance, which requires PHP code to be GPL/compatible but allows proprietary licenses for JavaScript, CSS, and images. 100% GPL or compatible is required for promotion at WordCamps when WordPress-derivative works are involved, the same guidelines we follow on WordPress.org.

By selling a theme on Theme Forest, the only option available to authors is a split license, in which the CSS, Javascript, and images are distributed with a proprietary license. For Jake to become 100% GPL, he would have to stop selling on Theme Forest and find a new channel for selling his themes. This meant loosing access to the more than 2 million members of theme forest.

The community was up in arms about Jake being banned from WordCamps. Many were angered by the actions of WordCamp Central; people thought it was unfair to ask theme sellers to give up their livelihood simply to speak at a WordCamps. Besides, couldn’t theme author sellers simply not mention Envato or Theme Forest in their presentations? There were also those who supported WordPress.org, seeing it as consistent with their ongoing stance on the GPL. If a developer wanted to sell on Theme Forest it was their choice, just as it was WordPress.org’s choice to only support 100% GPL products.

On both sides, people were angered for theme authors who sold on Theme Forest. Whereas the issue had little impact on the powers-that-be at WordPress or Envato, the theme authors stuck in the middle were the ones to suffer. They had no choice about their license and moving off Theme Forest would lose them their livelihood, in the short term at least.

The argument raged in the comments thread of Jake’s blog, spiralling elsewhere to other [WordPress community blogs](http://www.poststat.us/what-now-for-commercial-theme-authors/), and to the [Theme Forest forums](http://themeforest.net/forums/thread/wordpressorg-bans-themeforest-members-from-participating-in-official-wordcamp-gatherings/85648?page=2). Matt joined in the discussion on Jake’s blog, [saying that](http://www.designcrumbs.com/automatically-blackballed#comment-430) if Theme Forest authors had a choice about licensing and could release their theme under the GPL, then “Envato would still be breaking the guideline, but Jake wouldn’t, so it’d be fine for Jake to be involved with WordCamps.”

Rather than joining in with the comments, Collis Ta’eed, CEO of Envato, [responded on WordPress news blog WP Daily](http://torquemag.io/themeforest-wordcamps/). In the post, he outlines the reasons for Envato’s licensing model. As a designer himself, Collis’ main concern is protecting his designer’s rights while ensuring that customers are able to adequately make use of the resources they purchase.

Like so often in WordPress’ past, the argument came down to a difference of emphasis. While WordPress emphasised the freedom of users, Envato emphasised the rights of creators. Both felt strongly that they had the moral imperative, and for either to back down would be to violate principles that underpinned their organisation.

Collis discussed the possibility of having a fully GPL option for authors he wrote “I worry that external pressures will force an increasing number of our authors to change their license choice, some happily, some not.” Having just one (split) license meant that authors wouldn’t be forced into that situation. Collis’ concerns weren’t completely unfounded. By targeting Theme Forest sellers rather than Theme Forest itself, it was clear that WordPress.org was prepared to use theme authors against Envato. With authors themselves asking for a GPL license, the pressure in the situation was increased. 

The issue came down to one of choice. Theme authors had a choice whether to sell their themes on Theme Forest, or sell their themes in a way that was in line with the WordPress community’s ethos (and thus speak at WordCamps). But in a podcast on WPCandy, Jake made it clear that he felt that he didn’t have a choice about where to sell his themes. Theme Forest had become such an important part of his income that he would have to forfeit that income if he moved elsewhere. He went on to say:

> I think I’ve been wrong in my stance. I would like to change that stance, and feel that ThemeForest should offer an option for authors, if they choose, to sell their themes with a GPL license covering the entirety of the theme. I am going to take this option to our community.

He announced in the post that he would open a survey for Theme Forest authors to see if they wanted a GPL opt-in option. [The results](http://notes.envato.com/news/survey-results-about-gpl-opt-in-choice/) demonstrated that an equal amount of verified authors would license their themes under the GPL as those who wouldn’t, though 35% of sellers said that they didn’t know what they would do. It also showed, however, that theme authors who wished to distribute their themes under the GPL were mostly unconcerned about piracy, while the majority of those who wished to stick to a split license or who didn’t know were much more concerned about piracy. They were also much more concerned about the resale and retribution of their products. On 26th March, Collis announced that theme authors [could now sell their themes on Theme Forest with a 100% GPL license](http://notes.envato.com/general/100-gpl-option-now-available-plus-woothemes-arrives/). Jake was [once again allowed to speak at WordCamps](http://www.designcrumbs.com/un-blackballed).
