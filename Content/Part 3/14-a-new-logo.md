## 14. A New Logo

As development came together, so WordPress’ design and branding started to take shape. Some of the first lengthy discussions about the look and feel of WordPress happened on the [wp-design mailing list](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/). This was a private mailing list of designers and developers who were interested in crafting WordPress’ aesthetic. The main group comprised Michael Heilemann ([michael](http://profiles.wordpress.org/michael)), Khaled Abou Alfa ([khaled](http://profiles.wordpress.org/khaled)), Joen Asmussen ([joen](http://profiles.wordpress.org/joen)), Chris Davis ([chrisjdavis](http://profiles.wordpress.org/chrisjdavis)), Joshua Sigar ([alphaoide](http://profiles.wordpress.org/alphaoide)), and Matt.

The first focussed design discussion was about WordPress’ logo. The original logo was designed by Matt and was simply the word "WordPress" in the Dante font:

Since the project was so small community members had fun on the homepage, riffing on the logo with versions for seasonal holidays, birthdays, and other events.

Eventually, however, WordPress needed a logo designed by a professional. Usage of the software growing and it needed a logo that properly represented it. As a FOSS project, the first place to look for a logo was in the community. The community was asked to make suggestions about the logo. A mixed set of results came back, which were shared with the wp-design group for feedback.

The [first suggestions](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-March/000163.html) were from Andreas Kwiatkowski

A [second batch came](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-March/000171.html) from Denis Radenkovic:

The feedback for the logos was mostly lukewarm, though [some of the](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000175.html) [designers](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-March/000173.html) liked Radenkovic's heart logos, describing them as "instantly recognisable" . 

The heart logo was iterated on, with another version posted to the design mailing list: 

![Asmussen first design](../../Resources/images/14/2005_05_wordpress-logo-proposal_asmussen_sample.jpg) 

And a version of the admin screen with it in situ was produced.

It wasn’t just community members who were tackling the logo. In March, Matt met [Jason Santa Maria](http://jasonsantamaria.com/) at South by South West and asked him to try redesigning the WordPress logo. They shared ideas about what they thought the logo should be: "the things that kept coming up were not only the idea of publishing but the idea of having a personal journal and a personal thing that might have some sort of tactile overtones," says Jason now.  "We were making links to things like letterpress and journaling and any sort of older representations of what it meant to publish something in a physical form." In April, [some of the early versions were shared](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000182.html) with the wp-design group:

There were a number of responses from the designers on the mailing list: ["a little too aristocratic"](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000194.html) was one of the comments. The designers [felt that the design by Denis Radenkovic](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000185.html) was more in line with WordPress' brand. 

More designs were posted to the group:

The members of the mailing list didn’t seem to be in agreement on the subject of WordPress’ aesthetic. On the one hand, there were people who felt that the logo should represent warmth and community, and on the other something classic and elegant. To reach a consensus, discussions happened off-life. Khaled [reported back](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-design/2005-April/000192.html):

> WordPress is meant to be the Jaguar or Aston Martin of Blogging tools. [...] that line sets the stage for what the design of the branding should be. Elegance, polished, and impecably [sic] designed is where we should be aiming. 

The logo was finally decided on May 15th, when Matt sent an email to the mailing list with the subject "I think this is it". It contained just one image:

The major change to the logo, other than the new typeface, was the mark. The creation of a mark gave WordPress a standalone element of the logo which, over time, would be recognisable even without the word beside it. This could be used in icons, branding, and t-shirts. It’s become instantly recognisable, helped by its appearance on WordCamp t-shirts the world over.
