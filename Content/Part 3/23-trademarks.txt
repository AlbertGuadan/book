## 23. Trademarks
It was around this time too, that strain started to show in the relationship between Automattic and the WordPress community. This was around the issue of the WordPress trademark. When the project was set up no one owned the trademark. As interest in the project spread, communities cropped up all over the world. These WordPress user groups set up their own website - wordpress.dk, wordpress.fr, wordpress.pt,  for example - which they used as gathering points for their communities. They often had translated documentation, links to download localised versions of the software, and support forums where they could provide support to people in their own language. There was a general sense among many in the project that the WordPress trademark - the name and the logo - did not belong to any individual but to the project itself. This meant that anyone should be able to use it.

In [March 2006 Automattic filed to register the WordPress trademark](http://www.trademarks411.com/marks/78826734). Trademark registrations can take some time, and the person filing the registration has to demonstrate that they are pro-actively protecting that trademark. Much of Toni Schneider’s early work at Automattic was focused on securing the trademark. He recalls now that part of his job was “figuring out how can we make this a very open brand that lots of people can participate in but it doesn’t just turn into some mess that doesn’t mean anything in the marketplace because everybody just uses it in different ways.” The broadness of WordPress means that it’s more difficult for users to know who they’re dealing with. If anyone could use the WordPress trademark it wouldn’t take long for it to be hard to tell which sites are from the official project and which are not. 		

Just prior to filing registration, a domain policy was added to WordPress.org, requesting that [community members not use WordPress in their domains](https://web.archive.org/web/20060221154915/http://wordpress.org/about/domains/). The problem with being permissive with a trademark is that the word or name can, over time, become generic: the meaning of the word changes from being an identifier for a specific product or brand and becomes and generic word. An oft referred to example of this is the word “hoover” which was the name of an American vacuum cleaner company became the common name for referring to any vacuum cleaner. The company failed to protect the trademark and the name was genericized. To prevent a trademark being genericized, the onus is on the trademark owner to protect it.		
Once the application to register the trademark was submitted, Automattic had to go about doing just that. This meant getting people who used WordPress in their domain name or product name to change it. WordPress had been a community project for two years and many people felt that they had a stake in it. There were plenty of websites that used WordPress in their domain names - some of these were community websites, others were businesses that were selling products and services around WordPress. And it wasn't wholly clear what people could and could do. While it was clear that using WordPress in a domain was out, could community members use WordPress in the name of their blog or website? Was it okay in subdomains? In the comment thread of [Lorelle van Fossen's blog](http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2006/10/26/using-wordpress-in-your-domain-name-dont/), community members are curious as to whether they can use label "on WordPress" (as in "Lorelle on WordPress") on their blogs. After considerable discussion in the comments, Lorelle updated her post to add:

> After many discussions with Matt and the WordPress Community and staff, it is official. It is a violation of trademark to use WordPress in your site’s domain name. You may use it in the title and in blog posts, however, please note that using WP or WordPress in the site title implies the site specializes in WordPress content. Don’t disappoint.		
One domain change that [caught some attention in the community](http://wank.wordpress.com/2006/03/17/wanky-wank-wank-wank/) was a site called wordpress-arena.com which was [running a WordPress theme contest](https://web.archive.org/web/20060422014104/http://www.arenawp.com/?p=10). After Alex King’s CSS style competition back in 2005, theme competitions continued to be popular in the community. They were a way of widening the pool of themes, allowed theme developers to show of their skills, and push the boundaries of what they were doing with theming. In the comments, Matt left a message of support, along with a note that said "Unfortunately for every cool usage (like this competition, potentially) there are a dozen scammers and spammers misusing WordPress, selling spamming scripts or copies of WP itself."		
Six months later, cease and desist letters were sent out people who persisted in using WordPress in their domain, and things started to get even more messy. The focus was on two websites that had been running for some time with WordPress in their domain name: [wordpressvideos.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060402224841/http://wordpressvideos.com/), run by Brandon Hong, and [wordpresstutorials.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20060705071350/http://www.wordpresstutorials.com/), run by Sherman Hu. Both of these websites were registered prior to WordPress’ trademark policy - when they were set up there was no trademark policy to break. These types of domains are more of a challenge to deal with than sites that straightforwardly sell plugins and themes. The main test for whether something is in violation of a trademark are is “likelihood of confusion”. So international community sites could easily be confused for the main project, as could sites selling plugins, themes, and other CMS.  Tutorials and books are not one of the main products provided by WordPress so it is more of a grey area. There are similar sites in the Adobe community (photoshoptutorials.ws & photoshopessentials.com, for example) which are not owned by Adobe but which are not seen as trademark violations. 

Both Sherman Hu and Brandon Hong were sent cease and desist letters and, as is often the case in the blogging world, a blogger [alerted the community](http://andybeard.eu/112/wordpress-trademark-scammers.html) to the fact that the two websites had been asked to stop using the name WordPress in their domain. In his post, he remarks on Automattic's tardiness in actually registering the domain and preventing others from using it. He also takes issue about the two sites being singled out: one of them had been online for a year and both provided WordPress services and had cultivated their own communities, they weren't, he felt, the "spammy products" that Matt thought they were. Besides, just a year earlier, there had been a link farm on WordPress.org.		
Matt [left a comment that had the internet marketing community up in arms](http://andybeard.eu/112/wordpress-trademark-scammers.html#comment-44):		
> I find most affiliate marketing quite distasteful, and we have not even though of hiring anyone in those or SEO fields, or offering training for any of the above.		
> When we do documentation or videos, it's free to everybody.
> If Sherman Hu or Brandon Hong had spent their time contributing to the Codex or support forums instead of trying to sell WP snake oil and taking advantage of a lack of good documentation in Open Source community software, I bet they would have made a lot more honest money by now.		

People [jumped to the defence of the two websites](http://andybeard.eu/112/wordpress-trademark-scammers.html#comment-63). Even those who were supportive of Automattic's position with regards to the trademark, were angered by Matt's positioning of the two sites as "snake oil" salesmen. Customers and friends of Sherman Hu flocked to the blog post to voice their support for Sherman. Outside of that blog, prominent internet marketers wrote about it on their blogs. They took issue with Matt branding long-copy sales letters as spammy and scammy. [Brian Clark, at copyblogger, pointed out that while a website's design](http://www.copyblogger.com/does-your-copy-look-spammy/) might not appeal to some people, it will appeal to others. 

Eventually the [sites came to an agreement with Automattic](http://andybeard.eu/134/wordpress-tutorials-business-as-usual.html). Sherman agreed to add a trademark symbol beside every use of the word WordPress and eventually [WordPress Tutorials came out with a redesign](https://web.archive.org/web/20061130162903/http://www.wordpresstutorials.com/?). Sherman shut the site down in 2008 after moving on to focus on his consulting business.

As well as having an impact on business communities, the trademarks enforcements had a broader impact on international communities, many of whom had registered sites such as wordpress.de and wordpress.fr. Once the domain policy came into force, it was not officially discussed with the wider community.
