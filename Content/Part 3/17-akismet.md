## 17. Akismet

Spam has always been a problem; it’s the old annoyance of unsolicited mail in your mailbox, but on a huge scale. In the internet age, spam has gone from the actual mailbox to the virtual mailbox, filling inboxes all over the world. Because blog comment boxes leave a gap open for anyone to enter data, blogs are notoriously susceptible to spam. Any opportunity for user-entered data, whether that’s a comment box or trackback, is a doorway for spam. 

WordPress, like every other blogging platform, is susceptible to spam. In 2005, there were ongoing discussions about how to deal with comment spam. At the time, there were a few plugins around, such as Spam Karma and Bad Behavior, and Matt was also working on his own anti-spam solution. His first attempt was a JavaScript plugin which modified the comment form and hid fields, but within hours of launching it, spammers downloaded it, figured out how it worked, and bypassed it. This is a common pitfall for anti-spam plugin: once they get traction, spammers pay attention and they quickly figure out how to bypass it. In late 2005 [Matt launched the Akismet plugin for WordPress](http://ma.tt/2005/10/akismet-stops-spam/). Akismet (which stands for Automattic kismet) is a way of dealing with spam in aggregate, a crowd-sourced spam-fighting tool. 	

Each time someone posts a comment to your website, Akismet checks it against all the comments in the database. If it's spam, it's deleted, if not it lands on your site. If spam gets through and a user marks it as spam, the comment is added to the database. So the pool of spam comments is constantly widening, making Akismet into something that is more effective over time. “It’s like all the kids on the playground ganging up against a bully.” says Matt, “Collectively we all have the data and the information to stop spammers, certainly before they’re able to have a big impact.”  		

In November 2005, there was a discussion on the wp-hackers mailing list [about plugins that could be bundled with core](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003162.html). An anti-spam solution topped the list. Akismet was discussed, though [not everyone was comfortable bundling a plugin that had a commercial element to it](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003177.html). Akismet is free for non-commercial use, but commercial users are asked to pay. This is based on an honor system and commercial users need to be up-front about their website’s intentions. Some questioned [the data Akismet collected and how it was stored](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/October/October26RawLog). Additionally, you needed a WordPress.com account to use Akismet, though WordPress.com hadn’t officially launched yet. It was still an invite-only service and not every WordPress user had an invite. Those who didn't have an invite could download the Flock browser but not everyone wanted to download a new browser to get anti-spam protection.

Despite some pushback, there was an [equal amount of support](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-November/003189.html). Not everyone found the pay-what-you-want honor system too jarring. Akismet is a service and has associated server costs. [In November, Akismet was checked in to core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/3161). When WordPress 2.0 beta came out that month, it came bundled with Akismet. WordPress users had a new weapon against spam. So that everyone could get the WordPress.com account they needed for Akismet, [WordPress.com opened for public signups](http://ma.tt/2005/11/wordpresscom-open/) two days later. 		

Concerns continue that a plugin that makes money is shipped with WordPress. People feel that this gives Automattic an unfair advantage. Discussions about whether Akismet should continue to ship with core surface perennially in the community, including among core developers and at core team meetups. "It seems an unfair advantage and it cuts against WordPress' goal of openness," says Mark Jaquith ([MarkJaquith](http://profiles.wordpress.org/MarkJaquith)), "That being said, spam is still a huge problem and Akismet is still the leading product, even though there are now alternatives."

The open nature of WordPress plugins makes it difficult to develop a widely-adopted anti-spam plugin with a public element to it. As soon as a plugin has wide-spread adoption, spammers study it and learn how to bypass it. Dealing with spam via a service means that the code can all be open source but the algorithm for dealing with spam need not be. While there are often discussions about adopting a model in which a number of different anti-spam options are recommended, it isn't yet viable. "The moment we recommend five plugins," says Andrew Nacin ([nacin](http://profiles.wordpress.org/nacin)), "the spammers will all target the other four that don’t have the ability to evolve and learn like Akismet does." It creates a challenging intersection between business and free software. Including a freemium plugin with the software doesn't gel completely with the software's openness goals, but, at the same time, taking it away could have a detrimental effect on users, which goes against the project's user-first principles. Akismet continues to be bundled with core, and the issue continues to be discussed.
