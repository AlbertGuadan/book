## 15 - WordPress Inc



As the project continued to mature, and usage of the software continued to grow, the lead developers needed to find a way to support themselves to work on it. Matt took a job at CNET, which allowed him to work on the project alongside his work for the company, but Ryan was working at Cisco, often 60 or 80 hours a week, and he would come home to work on his hobby - WordPress. Apart from the work and time that was being spent on the project, there were all sorts of associated costs that come with running a growing project. Server costs, for example, that increase as the project grows in popularity. 

At the start of March 2005, there had been 50,000 downloads of WordPress 1.5, and just three weeks later the number had doubled to 100,000. To celebrate the landmark, there was a [100K party in San Francisco](http://wordpress.org/news/2005/03/fifty-thousand/). On 22nd March, a group of WordPressers got together in the Odeon Bar in San Francisco.

At the party was Jonas Luster, [jluster](http://profiles.wordpress.org/jluster/). Jonas was an employee at [Collabnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CollabNet), the company behind Subversion. At the party he and Matt talked about what a company built around a free software should look like. Matt had an idea for an organisation called Automattic: an umbrella company that would include a number of different WordPress organisations. The first of these was WordPress Incorporated. At the party, Matt asked Jonas if he'd like to be involved. Jonas agreed.

Shortly afterwards Matt was on stage announcing the formation of WordPress Inc with Jonas Luster as employee number one. By the following morning, a [couple of blogs](http://sfist.com/2005/03/22/wordpress_incorporated.php) had [covered the announcement](http://laughingsquid.com/matt-mullenweg-announces-wordpress-inc/). A few days later, [Matt went on holiday](http://ma.tt/2005/03/wordpress-world-tour/) leaving WordPress' very first employee holding the reins.


While the party was going on, there was a storm brewing. In February, a [user had posted on the WordPress.org support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/odd-wordpress-articles?replies=6) asking about hundreds of articles hosted at wordpress.org/articles/. The articles were about everything from credit and healthcare to web hosting. The thread was closed by an unknown moderator. It was come across by blogger Andy Baio, however, who duly contacted Matt to ask him what was going on.

Matt provided Andy with an explanation. He was being paid by a company called Hot Nacho to host the articles on WordPress.org. He was using the money to cover the costs associated with WordPress. "The /articles thing isn't something I want to do long term," he told Andy, "but if it can help bootstrap something nice for the community, I'm willing to let it run for a little while." In addition to responding to Andy, Matt re-opened the support forum thread and [left a response](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/odd-wordpress-articles?replies=6#post-160502)	
> The content in /articles is essentially advertising by a third party that we host for a flat fee. I'm not sure if we're going to continue it much longer, but we're committed to this month at least, it was basically an experiment. However around the beginning of Feburary [sic] donations were going down as expenses were ramping up, so it seemed like a good way to cover everything. The adsense on those pages is not ours and I have no idea what they get on it, we just get a flat fee. The money is used just like donations but more specifically it's been going to the business/trademark expenses so it's not entirely out of my pocket anymore.		
On 30th March, while Matt was in Italy, Andy [published an article about it on his blog](http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/). The blogosphere exploded. No matter what Matt's intentions, people saw it as a shady SEO tactic. They felt that a free software project should know better than to get into bed with article spammers. Not only was WordPress.org hosting the spammy articles, CSS had been used [to cloak the articles](http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/#comment-18433). The fact that the articles were hidden only served to suggest that Matt knew that he was doing something wrong when he agreed to do it. If everything was above board, why not do it out in the open?		
With Matt out of town, it fell to Jonas to deal with the fallout from Andy's article. It wasn't clear where the [line between WordPress.org and WordPress Inc lay](http://waxy.org/2005/03/wordpress_websi/#comment-18519), but with Jonas was the only official-sounding person he was the one to receive the tech community's ire. 

The first that Jonas had heard of the articles on WordPress.org was at a party when someone suggested he go to check his emails. They'd been put there weeks before the WordPress Inc announcement. With Matt out of contact he spent the next few days putting out fires. He [posted on his blog asking for calm](https://web.archive.org/web/20050415082051/http://www.jluster.org/2005/03/spam-matt-wordpressorg-and-i-am-exhausted-bad-mix/), asking that Matt be given the benefit of the doubt. 

[Some people saw it](http://www.forevergeek.com/2005/03/wordpress_making_money_the_wrong_way/) as the first move by WordPress Inc to make money, and took it as indicative that Matt and Jonas were't going to monetise WordPress in an ethical manner. Jonas did his best to emphasise that the articles had nothing to do with WordPress Inc, but since there was little clarity about what WordPress Inc actually was, it was easy for people to lump them together.		
By the next day, Andy had updated his post to report that WordPress' PageRank had dropped to 0/0, which meant that WordPress.org had been removed from Google's search engine results. 

The WordPress and tech communities weren't the only people unhappy. Textdrive, who hosted WordPress for free on a  server along with apps such as Ruby on Rails, saw their server take a pounding from all of the hits from the links.		
The story escalated, with major tech resources picking it up ([The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/03/31/cnet_weblog_keyword_scam/), [Slashdot](http://slashdot.org/story/05/03/31/196220/wordpress-banned-by-google-for-spamming), [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2005/03/4759-2/). On March 31st, [Matt posted briefly on his blog](http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/) to say that he had just learned about what had happened and that he would get online to address the questions as soon as possible. The comments are littered with messages of support from [people who would later be central to the project](http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/#comment-18670) and even [from Matt's blog rival](http://ma.tt/2005/03/back-online/#comment-18673). He also received [support on WordPress' support forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/support-matt-mullweg?replies=23).		
	
On 1st April, [a full response was issued](http://ma.tt/2005/04/a-response/). In it, Matt stresses that he was struggling to find a way to support the open source project, that he felt that his options were limited:		
> To thrive as an independent project WordPress needs to be self-sufficient. There are several avenues this could go, all of which I've given a lot of thought to. One route that would be very easy to go in today's environment is to take VC funding for a few million and build a big company, fast. Another way would be to be absorbed by an already big company. I don't think either is the best route for the long-term health of the community. (None of these are hypothetical, they've all come up before.) There are a number of things the software could do to nag people for donations, but I'm very hesitant to do anything that degrades the user experience. Finally we could use the blessing and burden of the traffic to wordpress.org to create a sustainable stream of income that can fund WP activities.		
The decision to host the articles on WordPress.org was an attempt to mitigate some of the costs of the open source project. For many people, Matt's response sufficed to answer their concerns and questions. [But for others, it wasn't enough](https://web.archive.org/web/20050922005353/http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/04/01/there-is-communicationand-then-theres-not/). If a open source project had to resort to turning it's highly ranking website into a link farm, what was the future viability of that project? Weren't there other ways to support it? Matt had been at the [web spam summit](https://ma.tt/2005/02/at-spam-summit/) in February, which had [specifically addressed](http://www.sifry.com/alerts/archives/000288.html) "comment spam, link spam, TrackBack spam, tag spam, and fake weblogs". Hadn't he, at that point, realised that there might be something dubious?		
As with most storms on the internet, when the articles were removed and Matt had issued his apology the anger subsided. It did, however, have a lasting impact in a number of ways. It changed Matt's thinking about spam away from viewing it purely as something that is received in an email inbox, to web spam, which could quickly pollute the web. This fed into his thinking when developing Akismet, Automattic's anti-spam solution. And while Matt had learned a harsh lesson about ethical ways to make money on the web, it would return to haunt him again and again. Any time WordPress.org clamped down on search engine optimisation tactics, in themes for example, irate community member would bring up hot nacho.


Jonas' first few weeks at WordPress Inc got off to an explosive start, and over the next few months he would continue to do unpaid work as WordPress Inc's only employee. He got in touch with major web hosts and created partnerships so that WordPress.org could make money by recommending hosting companies. He met with venture capitalists to talk about where WordPress was going.		

At an [IRC Meetup in August 2005](https://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/August/August03RawLog), Matt discussed some of the ways he wanted to see the project supported. Rather than go down the route of fundraising, he wanted to see a company that was responsible for generating revenue and that "the goal, eventually, is for it to be the biggest contributor someday, supporting community members to work on WP full-time." Donations to the project would be kept separate from the company. This would protect the project from any of the liabilities of the company and ensure that if the company was sold the project would be safe. In this chat, it's clear that the "inc" that Matt refers to in the chat isn't WordPress Inc, but the as-yet-unannounced Automattic. When asked about the employees, he says that the only one is Donncha, with Ryan Boren planned for the future. WordPress Inc itself fizzled out, disappearing with much less fanfare than it arrived. There wasn't money available in WordPress Inc to pay Jonas a salary, especially when Matt was using his own salary from his job at CNET to pay Donncha to work on WordPress.com.		
The wider community was [confused about what had happened with WordPress Inc](https://web.archive.org/web/20110816084138/http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/008169.php), especially those who had watched Matt on stage announcing the launch of the company. In response, Matt [posted a page on the WordPress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/User:Matt/WordPress_Inc_Story), trying to explain what had happened:		
> At the WordPress 100k party in March 2005, I talked about the formation of a "WordPress Inc." with Jonas Luster as the first employee. That never really got off the ground, I continued my job at CNET and Jonas (who I couldn't afford to pay a salary) ended up going to work for Technorati. It wasn't even planned to be announced at the party (since it wasn't clear logistically how it would happen) but everyone was really excited about it and I had an extra G&T (or two), we all got carried away.

The first movement towards making money to support the project was more of a stumble than a step. It did produce some important lessons, however, about how to run a business alongside FOSS project.
