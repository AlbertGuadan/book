## 22. Faster Release Cycle

Shuttle wasn’t the only project that was taking longer than it should have. There was more than a year between the Shuttle-inspired WordPress 2.0 and the next version, WordPress 2.1.. It was more than a year between the release of WordPress 2.0 and 2.1. In an [essay on his blog](http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/), Matt describes the year between 2.0 and 2.1 as “a dark time in WordPress development history, a lost year.”  

WordPress’ release cycle has often been sporadic, particularly in the early days. Sometimes releases just had a few months between them, other times longer. Between 1.2 and 1.5, for example, there was a gap of 265 days. The codebase was packed with changes and the decision was made to skip a few version numbers, [going straight from 1.2 to 1.5](http://wordpress.org/news/2004/12/version-skip/). This was at a time when version numbers were attached to versions in a much more haphazard way. The approach that the project adopts now is that the current release is the first two numbers, and each release is a major version. So 1.5, 2.0, 2.9, 3.4, and 4.0, for example, all have the same weighting as each other. Patch releases have an additional decimal point - so 2.0.1, for example. This is different to the approach taken by many other software projects. In Drupal, for example, Drupal 6 and Drupal 7 are major releases, but the releases with decimal points are not. The approach, spearheaded by Matt, was to avoid version inflation. Over a period of years, the version number for a piece of software can quickly get high. The decimalisation avoids that.

Between WordPress 1.5 and 2.0, however, the project hadn’t quite settled on its approach to version numbering and so 1.6 was inflated to 2.0. This was partly to do with the number of features in it, and also because there had been 314 days between releases. But the delay between 2.0 (released December 31 2005) and 2.1 (released January 22 2007) was the longest so far.  

The mailing list was active, and more developers than ever were attracted to the project. WordPress itself downloaded 1.5 million times. But while emails were being sent, no code was actually being shipped. The [release post for WordPress 2.1 has a plethora of new features](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/01/ella-21/) demonstrates the problem. The problem wasn’t a rift in development or any major changes in the project, but the constant desire to slip in just one more feature, a refusal to acknowledge that that new feature could wait until the next release. This meant that the release was packed with features but it took more than a year to get there. 
	

All of this delay meant that many developers in the project were getting frustrated - not just because the release cycle was taking so long but because commit access was still restricted to just Matt and Ryan. For many developers, the delays to development could party be attributed to the restrictive commit policy. There was a clear difference in opinion about how commit access in the project should be managed. Every FOSS project approaches commit access differently, so there was a mixture of people who supported the Linux-style commit policy and those who didn’t. Ryan argued that the [benefit to having funnel](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005192.html) was that it avoided having “bridge burning arguments happen in the repository rather than in ticket comments." Discussions about approaches and implementation were had before code touched the repository. If the code has already landed in the repository it’s much harder to remove. An open commit policy brings its own challenges and some who’d been involved with open commit FOSS projects [supported the funnel](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005195.html). "Loose control leads to spaghetti code and flame wars over inconsequential issues," wrote Douglas Daulton, in a post to wp-hackers.

In the context of these discussions, Ryan [codified some of the project’s process that remain part of the development process today](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005190.html):
- every commit must be accompanied by a ticket
- before commit, the code is reviewed by at least two people - one for a code review and the other for an integration/architecture review
- these reviews are carried out by trusted contributors.

Ryan suggested that a #wordpress-dev channel could help facilitate discussion around development. The #wordpress channel had become a place for both general chatter and for providing support. This meant that the focus wasn’t primarily on development. There were slow, but positive changes to the project. Mark Jaquith [pointed out the success of the Bug Gardening scheme](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-March/005189.html) which had started the previous year in the context of other discussions about opening commit. Opening up trac privileges to “bug gardeners” who were responsible for triaging tickets had distributed some of the workload and led to "a whole slew of people who are autonomously fixing bugs, submitting  patches, and having them committed." Another positive change was the trac mailing list, which had transformed trac from simple bug-tracking software to a locus for discussion. This kept discussion focused on specific tickets and issues,  curtailing somewhat the tendency on wp-hackers for discussion to meander off into rabbit holes. 

As work on WordPress 2.1 continued, Ryan posted to wp-hackers about [getting WordPress 2.0 into Debian stable](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-October/008871.html). This would mean WordPress would be included in the Debian distribution.  At[ what does it mean to be in Debian Stable?
] the time, WordPress was part of the Debian unstable/testing distribution. For inclusion in the stable distribution, WordPress 2.0 would need to be maintained for 3-5 years. The task fell to Mark Jaquith to maintain the 2.0 branch. The project committed to maintaining the version for three years, until 2010. This involved backporting security issues to ensure that the version remained stable.


Shortly after he took on the legacy branch, [commit access was given to Mark Jaquith.](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/4270). Mark had been involved with WordPress since 2004, coming to the project along with the exodus from Movable Type. In his two year involvement with the project he’d made a number of contributions, including to the successful bug gardening scheme. It was a sign that the funnel was starting to broaden, and the beginning of a period when, slowly but surely, more committers were added.

Commit access was given out sparing because it wasn’t just given out on the basis of coding expertise or how much work a developer had done. Adding a new committer meant trusting them to follow through with the vision of the project, to be someone sympathetic to the project’s user-first ethos. Then, and now, that’s a key aspect in deciding who is given commit access. “It’s not just that you’ve shown a commitment to contributing,” says Peter Westwood now, “but you also have shown an understanding of the ethos of the community and their shared beliefs, and their philosophies.”


	
Despite adding another committer, the development cycle wasn’t significantly sped up, and the development team decided to take a more serious look at how development process operated. Since WordPress’ first release, new versions had been arriving haphazardly, and as the number of users and developers grew the outside impression of the project was somewhat chaotic. There was no real structure or process to development. 

A discussion was started wp-hackers about [moving to a 120 Day release cycle](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-October/008907.html). Matt wrote that a release could look like:	
> 2 months of crazy fun wild development where anything goes
> 1 month of polishing things a little bit, and performance
> Feature freeze.	
> 1 month of testing, with a public beta release at the beginning	
The response was positive from the development community. This gave them a concrete deadline for them to work toward. Having shorter release cycles also meant that if a feature was holding up a release it could be pushed to the next one. In theory, this should prevent there from being any more delays, in practice this often depended on what the feature was, how far along development of that feature was, and who the person spearheading that feature was.

When WordPress 2.1 was released, it was the first to launch with a concrete release date for the next version: [April 23rd for WordPress 2.2](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/01/ella-21/). The publication of the release date meant that the project now had a deadline which it was beholden to. Anyone who followed WordPress’ development would be expecting to see the next version land on that date. A deadline, amongst some in the project, came to be seen as a promise to users - a promise that the next version would appear at a specific time so that users could plan around it.

The project didn’t quite make the next deadline - but were only a few weeks out, with WordPress 2.2 [released on 16 May](http://wordpress.org/news/2007/05/wordpress-22/).
