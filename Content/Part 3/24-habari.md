## 24. Habari

As all of these changes were happening at a time when there was some discontent in the project. The project had grown to include a large group of developers, support forum volunteers, documentarians, and other people who were interested in helping out. Many of these people had been around since the early days, and while the project and software had grown and changed, there were those who felt that the governance structure had not. WordPress has always had a Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) structure, meaning that the final decision often lay with the BDFL - Matt. In practice, it was often Ryan Boren who made and implemented most of the technical decisions. However, there were those in the project who felt that the project could benefit from a committee structure, with a team of people driving the project’s direction and decision making. Some project members were unhappy with the way that Matt was leading the project, and [ended up leaving](http://skippy.net/wordpress-less). Different people had different opinions on how a free software community should be run. And it was in this context that first major fork of WordPress happened - though it wasn’t a fork of the software, but a fork of the community.

The people who were unhappy happened to come together in September 2006, at Ohio Linux Fest in Columbus. They decided to have lunch together at a Buca di Beppo in Columbus. They sat at a giant lazy susan table that had a plexiglass-encased bust of Pope John Paul at the centre. Four of those who attended were WordPress developers - Owen Winkler ([ringmaster](http://profiles.wordpress.org/ringmaster)), Rich Bowen ([drbacchus](http://profiles.wordpress.org/drbacchus)), Scott Merrill ([Skippy](http://profiles.wordpress.org/skippy)), and Chris Davis ([chrisjdavis](http://profiles.wordpress.org/chrisjdavis). During lunch they each talked about grievances that they had with the project, and the topic of conversation kept swinging back to the possibility of setting up a new open source project. The same story came up again and again - patches rejected over and over again because they didn’t fit with the vision of the project. By the time the meal had ended, the four WordPress developers had decided [http://matsu.wordpress.com/2007/01/08/witnessing-the-birth-of-an-open-source-project-habari/](to stop talking and act), settling on creating a new blogging tool. A few weeks later at ApacheCon, they came up with a name: Habari, which is a Swahili word for "What's up?" or "What's the news?" At the same gathering, they came up with the governance structure and development ethos of the project, and started work on it in earnest.

The significant flash points still resonate in the minds of the founding Habari developers today. Habari was launched in January 2007, and many of the founding philosophies of Habari are in direct opposition to those of the WordPress project. The [Habari Motivations](https://web.archive.org/web/20070111191036/http://code.google.com/p/habari/wiki/Motivations) page lists the reasons for being involved with Habari. Each of the motivations is something that the founding developers saw as wrong within the WordPress project, that they wanted to change in their own project.  They are emblematic of the different approaches to running a free and open source project (FOSS), and also highlight some of the problems that were afoot in the project three years following its launch. Every FOSS project, indeed every group or community, has its problems, especially one that has been established for a few years. Problems that may have been ignored during the initial heat of enthusiasm become entrenched and as enthusiasm fades they come to the surface.

One of the major issues was around the style of governance in the project. Many weren’t happy with the BDFL model. A BDFL governance model is fairly standard across open source projects, with notable BDFLs being Linus Torvalds of Linux and Rasmus Lerdorf of PHP. A BDFL is a free software project leader - it means that there is one person who has final say about the direction and vision of a project. In reality, as a project grows there are often numerous people who have an influence and who make decisions about project direction. 

Rich Bowen, one of the developers who was dissatisfied with how WordPress was being run, came from the Apache project. Apache has done away with the BDFL structure and instead has a committee model. The committee is made of up both developers and non-developers, all of whom have a say in the running of the project. Unlike WordPress, which only required that commits be approved by the committer and/or the patch reviewer, commits in Apache require a consensus. Habari launched with a committee structure, much like Apache. Decisions were made by consensus by a committee of people.

One of the people who was lured to Habari was the [designer Michael Heilemann](http://web.archive.org/web/20070117005952/http://binarybonsai.com/archives/2007/01/07/time-to-habari/), who’d been the designer behind the Kubrick theme and who had become somewhat disillusioned with WordPress after the Shuttle projec[ Check this in Michael’s interview]t and with the growth of Automattic. 

Michael undertook a redesign of the Habari interface, which he says now was both a good and a bad experience. He had a good experience designing it, a bad experience getting it approved, and a good experience implementing it. The experience that he had getting it approved came down to the fact of Habari's committee structure. A lot of time was spent discussing approving the new admin interface. People would weigh in with opinions who weren't designers but whose voice was given equal credence. For Michael, this left him feeling that he couldn't get his work done and he ended up bowing out of the community. When asked about whether he is more comfortable with a BDFL or Apache-style model, he says now: 

> It’s easy to end up in very long discussions if everybody has equal footing. And that makes for a great democracy, but it’s also very hippie, 60s, everybody gets to sit around and share their opinion, but that’s not always something that’s really worthwhile. You don’t actually, necessarily, get a better product out of it. And so often you need somebody with vision, or at least somebody with a point of view with opinion to weigh in.

Another flashpoint was around the issue of commit access. In the Apache project, there was (and is) a clear path towards getting commit access to the repository. In WordPress in early 2006, it was obvious that commit access would not be opening up to new committers any time soon, and definitely not to the number of people who wanted access. Only Matt and Ryan Boren had commit access to WordPress, themselves constituting a funnel and checking mechanism through which all the code would run. More committers were eventually added, but it was a slow process and one that led to frustration, particularly amongst prolific contributors. 

Coming from Apache, Rich brought a different perspective to the project, one that chimed with the more dissatisfied developers. For Rich, [WordPress didn’t constitute a true meritocracy](ttps://neosmart.net/blog/2007/a-clarification-on-wordpress/comment-page-1/#comment-10985) - there was no opportunity for those with ability to gain power and responsibility. The final decision over who did and didn’t get power and authority lay with the project’s leader - it was down to his discretion to determine who had ability and deserved power. When Matt, in a discussion thread, says that WordPress is a meritocracy because commit access is provided to "the best of the best of the best contributors who prove their worth over time with high quality code, responsiveness to the community, and reliability in crunch times,” Rich responds by pointing out that because the final decision lies with the BDFL it prevents the community from becoming a true meritocracy.

What lay at the heart of the discussion was a fundamental disagreement about how a FOSS project should be structured.  In _Homesteading the Noosphere_ Eric Raymond discusses [project structures and ownership](http://catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/homesteading/ar01s16.html), looking at how a project structure emerges over time. The emergence of WordPress' project structure very much follows what Raymond outlines - the project has a single owner/maintainer, or in the case of WordPress it had two - Mike Little and Matt Mullenweg. Over time, Matt assumed leadership of the project. As more and more contributors were attracted to the project those that were active would be given commit access. In WordPress' case, commit access carried with it an implicit level of authority. Those with commit access are the arbiters of the code that ends up in core and the code that doesn't. Matt [made clear on a number of occasions](http://codex.wordpress.org/IRC_Meetups/2005/June/June29RawLog) that he didn't "want it to be a status thing," but this didn't prevent it from becoming so.

While Matt tried to [maintain that](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001417.html) "Committing != community status. It simply is a way to ensure that all the code that goes into the core is reviewed before being distributed to the world," it didn’t prevent community members from naturally ascribing authority to those with commit access. There was nothing clear and prescribed about what it means to be a committer or a lead developer. Instead, these things grew organically and, for the community, authority naturally followed commit access to the repository, and commit access followed high quality code submissions along with an understanding and commitment to the project ethos. Commit is a symbol of trust and with only two committers it appeared that the project leads did not trust others in the community. 


This had another impact on the project: a lack of acknowledgement for non-code contributions. Because implied authority naturally followed code it meant that there were no no defined leadership roles within the project for non-coders. Commit access may have been given out sparingly to developers but authority and leadership was still in theory achievable to anyone who could write code. For those whose role was helping on the support forums, writing documentation, providing translations, or any of the myriad supporting activities that go on around software development, there was no formal way for those who worked hard and demonstrated a commitment to the project to be acknowledged. While coders were receiving props for code accepted into core, there was no system of acknowledgement for those who worked on supporting activities. So when there were rumblings of discontent, it wasn’t just coders who were complaining. 



Habari’s approach was the opposite of WordPress. Commit access was achievable by anyone. The [Habari motivations page says](https://web.archive.org/web/20070111191036/http://code.google.com/p/habari/wiki/Motivations)  "Our contribution model is a meritocracy. If you contribute code regularly, you will be granted permission to make contributions directly (commit access).” The project took this approach even further - it wasn’t just coders who received commit access. Owen Winkler, one of the Habari founders says:

> There are some people who are committers, who are part of the primary management committee in Habari who I would never want to actually touch the code because they don’t really do development. But we give them access to it because they’ve demonstrated that they’re part of the community and they’re actively trying to advance Habari as a project.

In Habari, commit access is a clear sign of trust and responsibility in the project, so much so that even those who don’t write code are given it. In a project in which commit access = responsibility and authority, it makes sense to give access to anyone who holds such a position within the project. However, if you're trying to create a project in which the two do not go hand-in-hand, keeping commit access as purely a checking mechanism makes sense. That said, it's not always clear to people within the project what constitutes authority and what doesn't, and having a commit access is inevitably a clear symbol of trust.


There were disagreements that went beyond those of governance and commit access. WordPress has always been user-focused. This means ensuring that the software works for as many people as possible on as many environments as possible. As a result, decisions are made that don’t make developers happy. From its inception, [questions were asked about whether WordPress would be rewritten](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/how-much-will-you-rewrite#post-16). WordPress has never been rewritten and developers have to deal with all of the technical debt. 

WordPress' focus has always been on users, and maintaining a good experience for them. Habari, on the other hand, was intended to be useful to users, but at its heart was an educational tool for developers. One of the driving ideas behind Habari was to create a tool that taught people about development, development best practices, and being part of an open source project. Rich Bowen, who did't know a lot of PHP, said that he hoped that the new project would teach him about it. This meant not just teaching developers about PHP, but educating them about best practices around coding methods and being part of an open source community. They eschewed WordPress' low barrier to entry in favour of an approach that would cultivate fewer developers but better developers. 

In a post [announcing the Habari Project](http://skippy.net/spread-the-news), Scott Merrill writes about how one of the founding principals behind Habari was to make it fully object-oriented. 

> This has resulted in some wonderfully efficient code, and so far the system is remarkably fast. Object oriented programming allows us to streamline the development of user-created plugins; allows us to integrate a unified error handling system; and vastly simplifies the construction of our Application Programming Interface.

Habari was written in PHP 5.1, allowing the developers to use [PHP Data Objects](http://php.net/manual/en/intro.pdo.php). This gave them a level of database independence which WordPress lacked. 

WordPress was completely focused on users, and ensuring that nothing broke for users. Habari was concerned with creating an educational tool for developers. On the one hand, the Habari developers found fault with WordPress for not using the latest coding practices, on the other, the WordPress developers felt that Habari's approach messed with users. As [Ryan Boren memorably put it](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2007-February/010881.html):

> Screwing users because developers want to play is not cool. It’s a good way to become irrelevant. A big reason WP is so popular is because it is not infatuated with the latest, greatest developer lust objects that require users to upgrade their platform.

In February 2007, when Ryan wrote the above comment, PHP 4 was still running on 88.44% of websites. PHP 5 adoption was slow and many web hosts didn't support it. If WordPress had made the switch to PHP 5 it would have meant that it was suddenly become unavailable on a huge number of hosts.

The other sign of this difference of emphasis is in the choice of license. WordPress has a GPL license, which is intended to secure the freedoms of users. Habari, on the other hand, uses the [Apache License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0). This permissive license allows developers to take the code and make use of it in any way, even if they use it in a proprietary product. In the Apache License, the emphasis is very much on developer freedom. Owen Winkler outlined the reasons why the Habari project chose not to use a GPL license:

> There's the idea of developer freedom. If you give the software away you should be able to give it away with no requirements at all. If you want to take it and make software that you sell, then go ahead and do that. Hopefully you won’t. Hopefully you’ll contribute. Or if do, you’ll contribute what you make back to the community somehow.

In contrast to copyleft licenses is a family of [permissive free software licenses](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_license). These licenses have minimal restrictions about how the software can be distributed.  

The BSD license, for example, lets someone take free code and put it within a non-free program. The difference is one of emphasis. A permissive license emphasises developer freedom, i.e. the developer is free to do what they want with the software. From the perspective of those who support permissive licenses, these are more free than a copyleft which carries restrictions about how the code can be used. A copyleft advocate, however, would say that the developer has taken advantage of the freedom offered to him or her, but doesn't not pass those freedoms on to someone else. They take from the commons without participating in it, they make use of freedom but deny it to others. A copyleft license, on the other hand, emphasises user freedom, i.e. the software must remain free for all users, all of the time. This adds to the widening pool of knowledge in a commons that is able to protect itself and continue the spread of that knowledge. 


All of these differences were, in the end, unresolvable. This was despite [Matt apologising for his stance on inline documentation](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-December/009812.html) and despite the fact that things were starting to change. Change was slow and the developers became more and more disenfranchised, but change was happening. Mark Jaquith recalls "I felt like […] Matt was right on the verge of loosening the reins, it felt like things were really starting to get good and they left. And I was like oh, if you’d just held on." 

But they didn’t hold on, and in the end went to found their own project with their own ideals and focus. Free and open source communities can be run in many different ways. Sometimes the emphasis is on free software, sometimes the emphasis is on open source. Sometimes the emphasis is on users, sometimes the emphasis is on developers. Sometimes the license in permissive, sometimes it is restrictive. The wider FOSS communities are broad and encompass people from a multitude of different backgrounds. Each project has its own set of ideals and cultural norms, and sometimes project members gel with those ideals and sometimes they don’t. When there is a critical mass of people within that project who don’t accept a project’s core ideals then there is always the possibility of creating a fork. This can be a fork of the software or, as was the case with Habari, a fork of the community. Then there are two projects, each with a laser-sharp focus on the things that matter to them and on the software and project that they want to create.
