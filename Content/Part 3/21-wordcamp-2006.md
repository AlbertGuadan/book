## 21. WordCamp 2006

The WordPress community has a long tradition of getting together. Even before WordPress held official events, there were small gatherings of WordPress community members and users. The first of these was [in June 2004, in San Francisco](https://wordpress.org/news/2004/06/meetup-location/). As well as meeting up to socialize, [people held upgrade parties](https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/upgrade-party/), before the days of the one-click upgrade, when users had to upgrade their sites using FTP. As well as helping users to upgrade, contributors also helped people to migrate from other platforms to WordPress.

Many free software projects host dedicated user conferences, where community members get together to learn, talk about the software, and socialize. Matt, along with Tantek Çelik, had been involved in setting up another conference series called Barcamp. Barcamps are informal, user-generated conferences focused on web technologies. They’re normally open, and workshop-style -- the attendees help create the schedule. In July 2006, Matt announced that he would be [host a Barcamp style event called WordCamp](http://ma.tt/2006/07/wordcamp/). "BarCamp-style" is a code phrase for 'last minute.'” [he wrote](http://ma.tt/2006/07/wordcamp/).

On July 9th he announced that the event would be on August 5th, and as yet had no venue or schedule. When they did get a venue, it was the Swedish American Hall. More than 500 people signed up for the event, and people came from all over the world: Donncha flew in from Ireland and Mark Riley from the UK. As well as attending the WordCamp, those who had started work at Automattic got together for a meetup to work on some Automattic projects.

The [WordCamp schedule](http://2006.wordcamp.org/schedule/) reflects the project's concerns at the time and also the breadth of people involved in the project. Mark Riley gave the first ever presentation at a WordCamp on how to get involved with the project. These are a staple of many WordCamps as community members try to inspire users to help out. Andy Skelton presented on the widgets feature that he was working on for WordPress.com. There were presentations about blogging and podcasting, about journalism and monetizing your blog. Donncha spoke about WPMU, and Mark Jaquith presented on [WordPress as a CMS](http://markjaquith.com/wordcamp/wordpress-versatility/), which he later reported was [one of the most-requested sessions](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2006/08/30/wordcamp-thoughts-late-to-the-game/).

WordCamp San Francisco 2006 was the first WordCamp at which Matt did his State of the Word presentation. This has become a feature of every WordCamp San Francisco. Matt talks about what’s happened in the past year and what’s upcoming for WordPress. In the first State of the Word, he [talked about how](http://dan.hersam.com/2006/08/05/wordcamp-notes/) the software needed to be kept simple. The plan was to simplify installation, and to make themes and the admin page more usable. He mentioned Mark Riley, who had been extremely helpful on the support forums, and said that documentation and support needed a lot more contributors. Matt discussed updates in the Q&A afterwards -- a major issue. Matt referenced Firefox, which alerted users to each new release. To know of a WordPress update, users had to follow the development blog. WordPress needed to be easy for people to update.

As well as the presentations, there was barbecue for lunch and a party in the evening, and the event, despite the short lead time, was a success. It was the first of a WordCamp movement that ignited in countries across the world. The second WordCamp was in 2007, again in San Francisco in the Swedish American Hall. The first WordCamp outside of San Francisco was WordCamp Beijing in September 2007, which was quickly followed by WordCamps in Israel, Argentina, and Melbourne, Australia. These events -- and WordPress events just like them -- were organized by volunteers in the community who wanted to get WordPress users together to geek out on the software. In the beginning, there was no formal structure to the WordCamp program -- if someone wanted to organize one they just did it. They were very informal user conferences, much like Barcamps themselves. It wasn’t until later, when the project had grown and the number of WordCamps across the world had exploded, that WordCamps started to get some structure.
