## 16. WordPress.com

As WordPress Incorporated dissipated, Matt pitched a WordPress-based blogging network to his employers at CNET. Many of the major internet companies at the time had a blogging network, including Google, Blogger, Yahoo 360, and Microsoft Spaces. CNET also owned several domains perfect for a blogging network, such as online.com. CNET decided against the idea but the idea itself didn’t disappear. Matt decided to build a blogging network himself. [^fn-1]. 

First, Matt needed to acquire the WordPress.com domain name. At the time, [Open Domain](http://www.opendomain.org/) owned it. Open domain registered free software project domains. They gave projects permission to use each domain in return for a website link on or some other form of acknowledgement. It was unclear to the WordPress community and the wider free software community whether open domain was a [domain squatter or an entity that genuinely wanted to help free software communities](http://archive09.linux.com/feature/140576). The organization also registered Drupal.com, though they [donated the domain to Drupal without major incident](http://buytaert.net/drupal-com). The WordPress community was perturbed over someone squatting on WordPress.com, despite good intentions. It was important to acquire the domain, rather than leave it with Open Domain and point the DNS at it. There was little security in a blogging network where a third party held the domain. How could anyone be certain that the third party wouldn't take the site down? After months of wrangling, Matt acquired the WordPress.com domain name.

With the domain name secure, Donncha, as the developer of WPMU, was the perfect choice to start building the network. At the time, his work bored him. He was looking for something more interesting. When Matt emailed the WordPress security mailing list to see if anyone was interested, Donncha got in touch. 

When it first started, WordPress.com ran WPMU trunk. When changes were made to WordPress.com, Donncha pushed them upstream to the core software. Development was fast; Donncha worked on two servers and live edited code. Without any users to worry about, he moved quickly. He improved user-focused functionality and built a network administration screen to properly manage the network. The WPMU community helped, submitting patches to clean up admin screens. Features developed for WordPress.com but which didn’t necessarily sit well in the WPMU core software were put into plugins like Domain Mapping and Global Tags. 

Andy Skelton ([skeltoac](https://profiles.wordpress.org/skeltoac)) was the second person to work on WordPress.com. Andy had developed a service and plugin called Blogs of the Day. This self-hosted stats plugin produced a list of the most popular blogs each day. The plugin offered website stats and a centralized server that recorded data. This produced the list of most popular blogs. Andy's script loaded the PHP and ran every time there was a hit on someone’s blog. After meeting in Seattle, Matt brought Andy on board to help create a stats plugin for WordPress.com. Andy used the knowledge he gained building Blogs of the Day which, for a number of years, was featured on the front page of WordPress.com. This made Blogs of the Day Automattic’s first acquisition. 

WordPress.com opened to signups in August 2005. The WordPress.com developers were concerned about scalability, so to control user growth on untested servers, signups were [by invite-only](http://matt.wordpress.com/2005/08/15/invites/). Many people who were involved with the WordPress project got a WordPress.com blog, including lorelle.wordpress.com, for example, and mark.wordpress.com. Every person who signed up got one invite to pass along. Demand quickly outstripped supply; one invite even landed on eBay. 

Downloading the Flock browser was the other way to sign up for WordPress.com. Flock was a social-media focused browser with social networking built in. “I thought Flock was the future,” [says Matt now](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_17_Mullenweg.html#L143). “First we did the invites, and then we thought well, we’ll allow you to bypass an invite if you’re using Flock because then we’ll know that you’re kind of a social in the know cool person.” Flock was integrated with WordPress.com so users could use it to post to their WordPress.com blog. Both of these measures -- invites and Flock -- allowed WordPress.com to grow in a steady and sustainable way. Putting in sign-up barriers controlled the flow of people and helped ensure scalability. 

It wasn’t just WordPress.com’s servers that had to scale. New-user influx meant higher demands on support. This, first of all, influenced the WordPress.org forums as users found their way there looking for help. There wasn’t a clear distinction between WordPress.com and WordPress.org and many people who needed support for WordPress.com went to the WordPress.org forums. This caused some discontent among the WordPress.org support forum volunteers, who felt that they were providing free work for a service which would eventually become commercial. 

To solve this problem, a support email address was set up for WordPress.com users. Originally WordPress.com’s developers did support, which diverted their attention from writing code to helping users. “I found that I would spend half my day replying to users,” [recalls Donncha](http://archive.wordpress.org/interviews/2014_04_08_OCaoimh.html#L48), “and then being completely wrecked in that your mind is completely taken off programming new features, or improving things, fixing bugs, just because this whole thing is so tiring.” After the mailing list, a community support forum was set up, and eventually a ticketing system. 

Mark Riley was active on the WordPress.org support forums. He was hired to do WordPress.com support. For a long time he was solely responsible for support at WordPress.com. The next person hired for support was in 2008. In that time 49,486 support tickets were closed. Nowadays, WordPress.com users have a community on their own forums and a huge team of "Happiness Engineers" supporting users across Automattic, but even today, it's not unusual for users to land on the WordPress.org forums looking for help.

Creating a user-focused blogging platform like WordPress.com made sense in the context of the WordPress project. WordPress has always been committed to users. It has always had laypeople at its heart, people who don't necessarily know the mechanics of how a server works but who want a website. WordPress.com was built for people who just want to fill out a form and have a blog, but still have the power of WordPress. This means that WordPress.com is a balancing act. There will always be those who want WordPress.com to be simpler, with less functionality, and there will always be people who want it more like the WordPress.org software, with plugins. To prevent people running code on their website, WordPress.com does not allow users to install plugins. Instead, WordPress.com provides a middle ground for people who don’t want to set up a WordPress website but who wanted to be able to blog.

However, a hosted service like WordPress.com needs a have a business behind it to pay for server costs, run the software, provide support, and build new features. The free software project, with its haphazard donations and income from hosting companies, couldn't maintain a such a network on a wide-scale. This business needs to be focused on WordPress’ main audience: software users. While this business was beginning to come together around the developers who had built WordPress.com, Matt was working on another product that would influence the WordPress community: an anti-spam plugin called Akismet.
