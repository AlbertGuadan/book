## 21. WordCamp San Francisco

The first WordCamp happened in August 2006 at the Swedish American House in San Francisco. It was set up by Matt, as a “barcamp-style” conference: “"BarCamp-style" is a code phrase for "last minute.”” [he wrote on his blog](http://ma.tt/2006/07/wordcamp/). He announced the WordCamp on 9th July, with August 5th as the date, and no venue settled. They did, however, manage to pull it together, and despite some snafus with the sign-up process, the event went well. At that very first WordCamp San Francisco some WCSF traditions were started: most notably Matt’s annual State of the Word presentation, and barbecue for lunch.
