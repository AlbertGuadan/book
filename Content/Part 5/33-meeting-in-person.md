## 33. Meeting in Person

In December 2009, the team of core committers - Matt, Mark, Ryan, Westi, Andrew - along with Jen, met in Orlando. Despite having worked together on the project for a number of years, it was the first time that some of them had met in person. They spent a few days there [discussing live issues in the project](https://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/intermission/) - “the merge, canonical plugins, the WordPress.org site, community stuff, and all the other things that are important but that we never seem to have time to address.” The were there to talk about the goals and the vision of the project. For the duration of the meetup, they worked from the hotel lobby at the Bohemian Hotel in Orlando. As well as discussing their goals they had a trac sprint that edged them closer to shipping WordPress 2.9.

The first of the results posts, [posted to the WordPress news blog](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/core-team-meetup-results/ highlights the breadth of the discussion: 	

> Direction for the coming year(s), canonical plugins, social i18n for plugins, plugin salvage (like UDRP for abandoned plugins), WordPress/MU merge, default themes, CMS functionality (custom taxonomies, types, statuses, queries), cross-content taxonomy, media functions and UI, community “levels” based on activity, defining scope of releases, site menu management, communications within the community, lessons learned from past releases, mentorship programs, Trac issues, wordpress.org redesign, documentation, community code of conduct.	

The benefit of meeting up in person is that time can be spent through issues, bouncing ideas around, and generally get work done. Jen recalls:

> We sat in these red velvet chairs in the bar of the Bohemian Hotel in Orlando, and when it was time to eat we would go into the dining room and we would eat. And we'd come back and we'd work, and we were on our laptops and actually going through trac as well. And doing bug scrubs, but then we would stop and we would have just conversations and we'd go outside maybe or we'd go out to lunch. And so we kind of mixed it up, and it was just so helpful. Both in terms of just getting to know each other better, and the actual work.

These types of meetups have continued to be part of core development, with members of the development team meeting up at WordCamps or at dedicated meetups to have code sprints and to discuss the direction of development or of the project more generally. These have been everything from small focused meetups of the core team, to large meetups involving the whole community. They provide an opportunity for people to discuss issues without the barrier of a screen, and also to take time away from work, to socialize, hang out, and generally get to know one another better. When community members meet up it can generate new ideas and old ideas are thrashed out in detail. They aren’t, however, without side-effects on the wider community. Meeting up in person, by its nature, excludes everyone who isn’t present at the event. This means that some people may be excluded, perhaps they can’t travel to the event for money or heath reasons. It’s important, therefore, in a free software project, to balance offline meetups with online activity which give everyone an opportunity to have a say.


One of the initiatives discussed at the first core meetup was canonical plugins. The number of plugins in the WordPress repository was growing, and many of them did the same thing. Some of them had poor code quality, some were out of date. There large, complex plugins that transformed WordPress. Sometimes plugins were dropped by the developer leaving users without support or updates. This can be a big problem if a user is heavily reliant on the feature. The core development team felt that some plugins warranted a similar development process to the development process in core - a group of developers to lead the development of a plugin, deciding what goes in and what doesn’t, in a similar way to how WordPress, BuddyPress, and bbPress are developed. Rather than having ten SEO plugins, or ten podcasting plugins, for example, there would be one canonical plugin, sanctioned by core with its own official development team. 

WordPress’ core development team were firmly behind the proposal, and [Jen posted about it on the news blog](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/12/canonical-plugins/).  In the post, she talks about the strong relationship between WordPress core and canonical plugins. This would ensure plugin code was secure, had the best possible example of coding standards, and new versions of WordPress would be tested against the plugins to ensure compatibility.

Much of the early discussion was about what to call this cluster of plugins. The community voted and decided on “core plugins”. A team that included Westi, Aaron Campbell ([aaroncampbell](http://profiles.wordpress.org/aaroncampbell, Austin Matzko ([filosofo](http://profiles.wordpress.org/filosofo)), Stephen Rider ([Strider72](http://profiles.wordpress.org/Strider72)), and Pete Mall ([PeteMall](http://profiles.wordpress.org/PeteMall/)), started work, with Westi from the core development team helping with infrastructure and processes.

The first plugins that were touted to be core plugins were the [Health Check](https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/) which checks the health of a website for common configuration errors and known issues, a plugin that shifted the post by email functionality from core into a plugin, and [PodPress](https://wordpress.org/plugins/podpress/), a popular podcasting plugin which had been abandoned.

Plugin developers weren’t so enthusiastic. They liked having ownership over their own plugins. There was an accusation that the project was trying to stifle the growing plugin market. Much of the discussion went on amongst developers, and the impact that the introduction of core plugins would have on them. In the midst of that, Justin Tadlock left [this comment on a discussion thread](http://onefinejay.com/2010/01/10/shackling-a-free-market-wordpress-canonical-plugins/comment-page-2#comment-7578):

> There’s been some great discussion here, but it seems a little one-sided. Most of the people leaving comments are developers. What would make the conversation much better would be to hear from more end users.

> I will refrain from sharing my opinion until I can gauge what a larger portion of the user base is feeling because, quite frankly, that’s the portion of the community that influences my opinion the most.

The feedback from users who joined the thread was positive: any help sifting through the mass of WordPress plugins is a great thing for users. Why should users have to sift through fifty contact form plugins when there could be one officially sanctioned plugin which would suffice for 80% of users? This could only have a positive impact on users. And the project did not intend to kill off the plugin market. Mark Jaquith, [who joined in on the discussion[(http://onefinejay.com/2010/01/10/shackling-a-free-market-wordpress-canonical-plugins/comment-page-2#comment-7589), tried to calm developer fears: “Core plugins will be safe and stable,” he wrote, “but limited in scope and probably a little bit boring and not completely full-featured. “

The core plugins project, however, was beset by other problems. While there was potential, there weren’t tools available for working effectively across a broad group of plugins. “We didn't have the toolset at the time to do it properly,” says Aaron Campbell, “without stepping outside of the WordPress ecosystem quite a bit and relying on something like a GitHub or something like that, which we prefer not to rely on for things that are really kind of the core of WordPress.” 

In order to properly manage the project, there would need to be a number of major changes to the project’s infrastructure. When the plugin repository was built it was designed with one author per plugin, without tools for developers to collaborate. While the plugin repository has become more flexible (it’s now possible, for example, to have multiple authors per plugin), it’s not got all of the collaborative tools that developers have become accustomed to. To have multiple developers working on the same plugin there needs to be a system to pass contributions in, discuss patches, modify patches, and merge them. To develop WordPress tools have been built around the subversion repository to make that possible, and the modified trac instance encourages collaboration. But each core plugin would need a replica of the infrastructure that WordPress uses itself, and it became obvious that the plan was untenable.	

To add to these problems, many of the developers were burnt out from WordPress 2.9 and were taking a break with the promise of a major release cycle in WordPress 3.0. They didn’t have the energy or time to commit to building core plugins as well as developing the core product itself. Despite the coverage the project got across the community, and despite the initial burst of energy, the project eventually fizzled out.
