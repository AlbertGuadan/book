## 39. Thesis
 
In mid-2010, one theme was still holding out against the GPL. The Thesis Theme from DIYThemes was one of the most popular themes around. It was created by WordPress theme designer Chris Pearson and blogger Brian Clark from Copyblogger. It is a feature-heavy theme that gives users way more options than they have in most WordPress themes. WordPress users could customise every element of their website via the user interface. On the original about page [Chris states the aim of Thesis](https://web.archive.org/web/20080610074529/http://diythemes.com/thesis/about/): "I wanted a framework that had it all—killer typography, a dynamically resizable layout, intelligent code, airtight optimization, and tons of flexibility." It was [featured on a number of tech blogs](http://thenextweb.com/2008/07/17/thesis-represents-the-next-generation-of-wordpress-themes/#!A2Baz) and adopted and endorsed by high-profile bloggers such as [Matt Cutts](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/switching-things-around/), [Chris Brogan](http://www.chrisbrogan.com/thesis-wordpress-theme/), and [Darren Rowse](http://www.problogger.net/archives/2008/07/18/thesis-a-wordpress-theme-design-worth-considering/).

Chris Pearson was well-respected in the community, having already developed Cutline and PressRow before moving into the premium theme market with Thesis. Thesis itself was influential on theme development. A [post from mid-2009 on ThemeShaper talks about](http://themeshaper.com/2009/05/21/design-popular-wordpress-theme-chris-pearsons-secret/) "The Pearson Principle": "Bloggers want powerfully simple design on an equally robust framework." With themes such as Revolution and Premium News, theme developers were already moving into creating themes packed with features, but Thesis cemented that move. Simple design on the front-end with options for full website customisation. It was the era of the theme framework [^fn-1], when a theme framework had as many features as WordPress itself and the user was able to create heavily customize their theme through the options panel. [Chris called this](http://themeshaper.com/2009/05/21/design-popular-wordpress-theme-chris-pearsons-secret/comment-page-1/#comment-9718) "ubiquitous design" - a theme was no longer just a website skin but a tool for building your website. It took another four years before theme developers stopped packing themes with options and started moving features into plugins.

While theme vendors adopted the GPL, Thesis held out. Discussions [happened between DIY Themes and Automattic](http://pomomusings.com/2009/06/04/switch-wordpress-blog/#comment-59022) awent nowhere.  Relationships were already fractious between WordPress and DIY Themes. In June 2009, as discussions were going on between Brian and Toni, a blogger's comments thread was [hijacked](http://pomomusings.com/2009/06/04/switch-wordpress-blog/) for a long debate about Thesis and the GPL. Matt users people to move away from Thesis, saying "if you care about the philosophical underpinnings of WordPress please consider putting your support behind something that isn't hostile to WordPress' core freedoms and GPL license."

For three weeks in July 2010, the debate between WordPress and Thesis raged. All of the major tech news sites took notice. It was ignited after an interview with [Chris Pearson on entrepreneur-interview website Mixergy](http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-thesis-interview/). In it Chris is expansive on the revenue generated from Thesis, putting a conservative estimate at 1.2 million dollars within 16 to 18 months.  

Just over a week later and [Matt and Chris took to Twitter.](https://twitter.com/pearsonified/status/18536597161). Matt was unhappy that Chris flaunted making so much money while violating WordPress' license. Cutting remarks went back and forth until Andrew Warner from Mixergy decided to get the two men in a virtual room. An [impromptu debate was set up and the issues were discussed live](http://mixergy.com/chris-pearson-matt-mullenweg/). The hour long discussion lays both sides out on the table. Matt argues that Thesis is built on GPL software, WordPress, and therefore should honour the license. By not doing so, he both disrespects all of the authors of WordPress and breaks the law. For Chris, adopting the GPL means giving up his rights and losing his protection from piracy. He argues that "what I've done stands alone outside of WordPress completely", and that Thesis "does not inherit anything from WordPress." The argument descends into a rambling discussion of economics, and the conversation ends with Matt saying that he's willing to sue Chris if he's not willing to comply with the GPL. 

Following the interview, more and more public action was taken against Thesis by Matt, Automattic, and WordPress. Matt [offered to buy Thesis users an alternative premium theme](https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/18548422506), consultants using Thesis were [removed from the Code Poet directory of WordPress consultants](http://www.flickr.com/photos/mg315/4792383313/), and Chris Pearson's other themes, Cutline and PressRow, were [removed from WordPress.com](http://www.pearsonified.com/2010/11/former-cutline-pressrow-theme-user.php). 

Matt wasn't the only person involved with WordPress to come out against Thesis. Other lead and core developers took to their own blogs to write about their stance on the GPL and Thesis. [Ryan Boren wrote](http://ryan.boren.me/2010/07/15/wordpress-theme-licensing/), "where do I stand as one of the primary copyright holders of WordPress?  I'd like to see the PHP parts of themes retain the GPL. Aside from preserving the spirit of WordPress, respecting the open source ecosystem in which it thrives, and avoiding questionable legal ground, retaining the GPL is practical." Mark Jaquith [wrote about how WordPress themes don't sit on top of WordPress](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/) but are interdependent with it. A theme is combined WordPress:

> in multiple different places, with multiple interdependencies. This forms a web of shared data structures and code all contained within a shared memory space. If you followed the code execution for Thesis as it jumped between WordPress core code and Thesis-specific code, you'd get a headache, because you'd be jumping back and forth literally hundreds of times.

Even developers who don’t agree that a theme is necessarily derivative of WordPress thought that Thesis itself was derivative. Developer Drew Blas [wrote a script that took every line of WordPress and compared it with Thesis.](http://drewblas.com/2010/07/15/an-analysis-of-gpled-code-in-thesis/) His script pulled up a number of instances of Thesis code taken from WordPress. Core developer Andrew Nacin [pointed out](http://nacin.com/2010/07/15/thesis-gpl/) that Thesis' own inline documentation read "This function is mostly copy pasta from WP (wp-includes/media.php), but with minor alteration to play more nicely with our styling."

A former employee of DIY Themes [left a comment on Matt's blog](http://ma.tt/2010/07/syn-thesis-1/#comment-481845): 

> check out Thesis' handling of comments (thesis/lib/classes/comments.php). Large chunks of it are ripped right from WordPress. I know they are… because I'm the one who did the ripping. Whether I informed Chris of that or not doesn't matter because I no longer have any of our old chat logs to prove one way or another, but suffice it to say the latest public release of Thesis (and numerous versions before hand) contain obviously GPL code. Whether those portions get rewritten in the impending 3.0 release, I don't know… but for Chris to claim that he was responsible for and devised all of Thesis at 13:33 or so in the debate… Well, he was lying to you, either intentionally or not.

On 22nd July, not even a week after the initial Mixergy interview, [Chris Pearson announced](https://twitter.com/pearsonified/status/19288707443) that Thesis was going to be released with a split license. The public furore compounded by pressure from inside DIY Themes forced Chris to capitulate. The license was drafted by [Brian Clark, who shortly after left DIY Themes,](http://technosailor.com/2010/07/29/exclusive-interview-brian-clark-leaves-diythemesthesis-theme/) citing "completely different opinions about the direction of the development of Thesis, the running of the company, and our relationship with the WordPress community." When Thesis 2 was launched in 2012 it had a new, proprietary, license.

The debate around Thesis and the GPL had far-reaching implications on everyone involved. [Prominent blogs moved away from Thesis](http://ma.tt/2010/08/syn-thesis-3-switchers/), with Brian Gardner's Genesis theme being a popular choice. Thesis and Chris Pearson became less prominent in the community, focused instead on cultivating and building upon a large customer base. It also made clear that WordPress is prepared to go to court when developers flagrantly abuse the license. There was, for a while, a relative calm in the community around the GPL. WordPress.org supported commercial theme sellers whose themes were 100% GPL and tolerated those that packaged their themes with two licenses. So when the next argument around the GPL flared up, this time it was about focused on the spirit of the GPL, as opposed to its legality. 

[^fn-1] The term “theme framework” is often used to refer to different things. In some instances, a theme framework is a base, or “starter” theme that a developer can build from. In other cases it’s a drop-in code library that facilitates development. But it’s also used in marketing to users, when a theme framework is a feature-heavy theme with multiple options.
