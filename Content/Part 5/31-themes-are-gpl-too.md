## 31. Themes are GPL too

As the project transformed, so the wider economy around WordPress follower suit. Then the Revolution Theme was licensed under the GPL in late 2008,  theme developers watched with curiosity to see if it had impact on Brian Gardner’s business. It seemed counterintuitive to give a product away for free and still be able to run a business. What better way to test the waters than to see how someone else’s GPL experiment plays out? 

As theme authors waited, the issue of commercial theme licensing was brought to a head. Just before Christmas 2008,[200 themes were pulled from the WordPress theme repository](https://web.archive.org/web/20090212220653/http://spectacu.la/wordpressorg-pull-200-gpl-themes). Premium theme developers and [the wider community](https://web.archive.org/web/20090315162659/http://www.jeffro2pt0.com/why-were-200-wordpress-themes-removed) were both annoyed. What was the problem with theme authors selling their themes? The themes hosted on the theme directory were free and complied with the GPL. As so often in the past, people conflated the actions of WordPress.org with Automattic and the company came under fire. The removal of themes from WordPress.org was seen as a sign that Automattic didn't want anyone making money. 

The rhetoric may have been hyperbolic but underneath all of that, theme sellers were genuinely unhappy. They hadn't been given any warning that their themes would be pulled from the repository. They just woke up one morning and they were gone. Many theme sellers saw their free theme releases as a way of supporting the free software community, and spent considerable time ensuring that they met the standards of the theme repository. They felt as though the rug had been pulled from underneath them: they'd done their best to comply with WordPress.org standards but suddenly it wasn’t enough. 

An email from Matt did the rounds in the community: 

> Thanks for emailing me about the theme directory. The other day I noticed a ton of bad stuff had snuck in like lots of spammy SEO links, themes whose sites said you couldn't modify them (which is a violation of the GPL), etc. Exactly the sort of stuff the theme directory was meant to avoid.

> There were also a few that violated WP community guidelines, like the domain policy. So since Monday we've been clearing stuff out en mass. If you're kosher with the GPL and don't claim or promote otherwise on your site and your theme was removed, it was probably a mistake. Give us a week to catch up with the bad stuff and then drop a note.

In a [podcast on WeblogToolsCollection](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/12/19/2hr-interview-with-matt-mullenweg/), Matt discusses his position on the premium theme market ([transcription](http://www.wpsnippets.com/2008/12/transcript-of-wordpress-weeklys-interview-with-matt-mullenweg-december-2008-part-1/). In the interview, he describes how, while updating a friend’s website, he was looking for WordPress themes in the directory. When he started looking he found themes with SEO links or linked to SEO sites, the behaviour that the theme directory had been set up to avoid. This led the team at WordPress.org to ask whether they wanted to allow GPL themes in the repository that only served as advertisements for non-GPL themes elsewhere. 

In the interview, Matt discusses the distinction between “premium” and “free” themes, and the importance of correct labelling. When it comes to "premium" themes, Matt argues that word "proprietary" makes more sense. It doesn't make a value judgement that themes that cost money are better than those that don't. “Proprietary” is also more accurate than "commercial" or "premium" to distinguish a theme from a GPL theme, because GPL themes, such as Brian Gardner's Revolution, can be commercial.

> I love what Revolution has done, where they say 'Ok, so we still sold the theme, and we still bundle the support and everything like that with it, but it's also available as GPL.' So they're able to, within the GPL framework, create a business and respect the underlying license of the community that they are building on top of.

Most importantly, in the interview he makes it clear that theme developers are free to do what they want on their site, but that the WordPress project is equally free to do what it wants on WordPress.org, and that includes whether it should or should not promote businesses that sell non-GPL WordPress products. Part of the aim of the theme and plugin repositories is to promote theme and plugin developers. The project doesn’t want to promote theme and plugin developers who follow the license just to get on WordPress.org but who then violate WordPress' license elsewhere. Therefore, theme sellers who sell non-GPL products outside of WordPress.org are not promoted on the site.

The interview provided a clear statement of what WordPress.org would and would not support. Even if people didn't like it they had their answer. The storm calmed and cleared the way for 2009, when businesses started to embrace the GPL.

In the months following the debate, discussions happened behind closed doors about how a business could be sustainable with the GPL. As the first to embrace the GPL, Brian Gardner provided advice to other premium theme sellers. In April 2009, [Spectacu.la](https://web.archive.org/web/20090619172730/http://spectacu.la/were-going-100-gpl/), the theme shop that first posted about themes being removed from the repo, announced that it was going fully GPL. It was was followed in June by [iThemes](http://ithemes.com/2009/06/11/ithemes-is-going-gpl/) and [WooThemes](https://web.archive.org/web/20100309084201/http://www.woothemes.com/2009/06/woothemes-gpled). 


In July, Matt announced that he had been in contact with the Software Freedom Law Centre which [provided its opinion on theme licensing](http://wordpress.org/news/2009/07/themes-are-gpl-too/): 

> the WordPress themes supplied contain elements that are derivative of WordPress's copyrighted code. These themes, being collections of distinct works (images, CSS files, PHP files), need not be GPL-licensed as a whole. Rather, the PHP files are subject to the requirements of the GPL while the images and CSS are not. Third-party developers of such themes may apply restrictive copyrights to these elements if they wish.

WordPress themes are not a separate entity to WordPress itself. As Mark Jaquith [wrote in a later blog post](http://markjaquith.wordpress.com/2010/07/17/why-wordpress-themes-are-derivative-of-wordpress/), “As far as the code is concerned, they form one functional unit. The theme code doesn't sit "on top of" WordPress. It is within it, in multiple different places, with multiple interdependencies. This forms a web of shared data structures and code all contained within a shared memory space.”

Following that announcement, more theme sellers adopted the license, though not all went 100% GPL (I.e. including CSS, images, and Javascript). Envato, for example, whose marketplace ThemeForest was growing in popularity, opted [for GPL compliance only with a split license](https://web.archive.org/web/20090819130204/http://blog.themeforest.net/site-news/important-change-to-wordpress-license-takes-effect-today-please-read) in which the PHP was GPL but the additional files were proprietary. 

Themes that are packaged in such a way follow the GPL to the letter of the law. The PHP carries a GPL license and other assets do not. They usually have some sort of proprietary license. This ensures legal compliance. It aims at protecting author rights by not passing on the freedoms guaranteed by the GPL - the freedoms to use, modify, distribute, and distribute modifications. Users are not free to do what they want with a theme licensed in such a way because the CSS and JavaScript are just as important to a theme as the PHP that interacts with WordPress’ internals. But it would be a number of years before this debate about licensing would be had.
