## 26. Sponsored Themes

While Automattic was the first to take steps towards making money with WordPress, it didn’t take long for it to spread to the wider WordPress community. WordPress was growing and as more people took notice of the software, more people needed WordPress products and services. While Automattic was focused on building a blog network and related products such as Akismet, there was scope in the wider community for those who were involved with the software to start to build businesses themselves. Developers who built the software were asked how much they would charge to do customization work or build websites. Often these were accidental businesses, with accidental business-people, people who came to the community to scratch their own itch and who then found themselves inundated with requests for help, support, and customizations.


In these early days, different types of businesses started to emerge as people tried to find ways to both support their hobby and to support the free software ecosystem. Ways in which people made money were through website customizations, but increasingly people wanted to make money with WordPress-products rather than with services. Why build one site when you can build one theme and sell it multiple times? Bloggers who used WordPress dabbled around with making themes. They’d release them for free; “a funny dynamic happened,” recalls Cory Miller, the founder of iThemes, “people started hitting my contact form and saying will you customise this, or will you do this theme, or will you do all that stuff, and I was like I’m, I’m kind of a fraud here. And so I started charging for my work.” This is familiar tale told by many of those who founded the most prominent WordPress businesses today. Many of the people who run those businesses started out simply making themes.

Throughout WordPress' history, themes have been divisive, moreso than plugins, and 2006-2008 were the years during which the theme marketplace started to find its feet. WordPress users, web users, have always been concerned with how their websites look. Everyone wants the latest and greatest design, wants to be ahead of the latest design trend. As WordPress became more popular, many of the bloggers started to build their own themes and would come to realise that they could make some money from them. Unlike the PHP developers who came to the project, these bloggers and designers didn't come from a culture of sharing. While developers are used to sharing code and distributing it with open source licenses, the same doesn't hold for designers. It was on his fault line that theme sellers clashed with the WordPress project. 

It wasn't obvious how someone could make money while still being in line with the ethos of a free software project. How could the two ever be commensurable? In those early days of the WordPress economy the distinction between freedom and free beer was often blurred. Community members fumbled for answers: is making money commensurate with a project whose core ethos is based on the GPL?  Who has the right to make money out of a project that belongs to all of its volunteers? How can a business be run when the core product is given away for free? How does one make money out of a WordPress theme?

Themes lagged behind plugins in terms of an official repository. For a long time themes were hosted on themes.wordpress.net, an unofficial directory of themes. Theme developers could simply upload their theme and users could browse the directory for themes that they liked.

However, the system was susceptible to spam and duplicate themes. Some theme developers tried to game the system by [downloading their theme multiple times](https://web.archive.org/web/20080415170633/http://themes.wordpress.net/blog/939/first-spammer-caught/) to appear at the top of the most popular results. The theme viewer was also at the centre of the debate about sponsored themes.



Theme sponsorship was the first attempt by theme designers to make money out of their designs. A designer often includes a credit link back to their own website in their theme. Kubrick, for example, had a link back to Michael Heilemann's website. Every site that installed the theme meant a link back to the designer's website. The number of incoming links to a website is a variable in Google's PageRank algorithm; the more incoming links, the higher the PageRank, the further up in Google's search engine results. If hundreds, or even thousands, of people install a theme, the designer could see themselves soar up Google's search results. Even better if that link comes from a high authority website. 

Designers soon caught on that the link didn't have to be to their website - it could be to anything at all. The links had an intrinsic value, particularly to internet marketers. With a link in a WordPress theme, marketers didn't have to approach individual sites to ask them for a link back; all they had to do was pay a web designer to include it in their theme, release the theme for free, and soon hundreds of sites would be linking back. 

For many it started out as a means of supporting their ability to distribute themes for free, but with WordPress growing in popularity it quickly became a problem. Interest in WordPress was growing rapidly. WordPress.com, for example, saw 70,000 people sign up in December 2006; in March 2007 its signups were at 120,000 for that month alone. Interest in the WordPress software matched[ see if I can get a stat on the WordPress software’s growth] that of WordPress.com, and the themes that were distributed were often the first coat of paint a new users put on their website. During a period between 2006 - 2007, many of these themes were dotted with sponsored links.

Theme sponsorship happened in a number of different ways. Sometimes companies would buy links by getting in touch with well-known theme authors to ask if they would sell the links in their themes. Theme authors themselves were also pro-active. Authors [set up websites where they would advertise and sell their themes](http://themey.com/), others would [auction the theme at Digital Point](https://forums.digitalpoint.com/threads/for-sale-pirates-of-the-caribbean-wordpress-theme-coded.284382/), or simply auction the links. Once the sale had been made, the theme was promoted on lots of different WordPress theme sites, including official sites such as the WordPress Codex, community resources like the WordPress theme viewer, and reputable blogs such as Weblog Tools Collection. These themes were often distributed with a [Creative Commons 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/us/) license, which permits free sharing and adaptation of the theme, provided the credit link remains. 

It didn't take long for websites focused on online money making to catch on. [Tutorials and articles were written about how to go about theme sponsorship](https://web.archive.org/web/20070306065553/http://www.doshdosh.com/link-building-and-seo/link-building-with-word-press-theme-sponsorship-a-good-idea/), and it became part of an acceptable "link building strategy".

Theme authors who carried out theme sponsorship usually fell into a number of different categories: some published themes with visible text links but didn't tell their users about the link, others used PHP or CSS to hide the links, others still made it clear that the theme had been sponsored. 

For [those who were in favour of theme sponsorship](https://web.archive.org/web/20130524074921/http://www.headsetoptions.org/2007/04/09/the-other-point-of-view-%E2%80%93-a-designers-opinion-on-sponsored-themes/), the matter was a simple one of being paid in return for work carried out. They shouldn't, they argued, be expected to create WordPress themes for free. Why shouldn't they be compensated for the work that they had done? Selling sponsored links was a way of ensuring that they could create and distribute themes for free, which benefited the whole community. They argued that designing a good theme takes time and that free themes were inevitably of a poorer quality than sponsored themes. 

Sponsored themes quickly became endemic, with even respected sources [selling links in their themes](http://www.bloggingpro.com/archives/2007/04/03/wordpress-theme-release-insense/). It became a ["great business model"](http://www.blogherald.com/2007/04/06/sponsored-wordpress-themes-a-great-business-model/); finally a way to make money from WordPress! Besides, those who supported the model argued that the default WordPress blogroll contained links to all of the original developers of WordPress - Alex, Donncha, Dougal, Michel, Matt, Mike, and Ryan - all of whom were benefiting in Google's search results. 

On the other side were those that argued that themes.wordpress.net was becoming a [repository for spam](https://web.archive.org/web/20070409100127/http://blogdesignsolutions.com/2007/03/31/wordpress-theme-sponsorship/). [More than 50% of themes](https://web.archive.org/web/20070417004542/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/04/05/deteriorating-community) on the WordPress Theme Viewer were sponsored themes. These contained links for everything from iPhone repairs to gambling websites, to web hosting and flower delivery. Some themes were uploaded multiple times with only minor changes, thereby increasing the number of links on the theme viewer. Critics of theme sponsorship, many of whom were designers themselves, blamed the practise for deteriorating the community. They weren't against theme designers making money, but they didn't want to see the WordPress community become a hive of spam and shady SEO techniques. Theme sponsorship opened the floodgates to an excess of internet marketing and SEO.

The issue of buying and selling links went beyond the WordPress community. A few years earlier, Matt Cutts, the head of web spam at Google, posted on his blog about how [link selling affected PageRank](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/text-links-and-pagerank/). Google's algorithm detected paid links, and while it wasn't foolproof it worked pretty well. The problem with paid links was that they made it harder for Google to determine the trustworthiness of a website. Google, as a result, took away that site's ability to give reputation: 
> Reputable sites that sell links won't have their search engine rankings or PageRank penalized – a search for [daily cal] would still return dailycal.org. However, link-selling sites can lose their ability to give reputation (e.g. PageRank and anchortext). Users were in a position that their site could be penalised for links that they weren't even aware that they were hosting. Hidden links could have an even more detrimental effect on a user's PageRank. 

In a post in April 2007, Matt Cutts returned to the the issue of selling links, condemning the practice of [hiding links in a website](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/hidden-links/) and asking web masters to make a full disclosure about paid links on their websites.

However, there were plenty of themes around that contained links that weren't sponsored. Designers [included a credits links in their footer](https://web.archive.org/web/20080104150212/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/04/11/design-credit-ramblings-again/), linking back to their own website. Designing and releasing a WordPress theme was a way for many designers to increase their profile on the web. Like the internet marketers, their websites would benefit from higher search engine results, and website visitors might click on the link, sending business to the designer. 

At that time, it was common for designer to release their themes under a creative commons license, with the only restriction being that the user leave the credit link in tact. In the middle of the furore about sponsored links, however, one designer took the next step. Tung Do, [tungdo](http://profiles.wordpress.org/tungdo) was the author of popular WordPress resource WPDesigner.com along with a number of popular WordPress themes. In April 2007, he announced that he was [releasing all of his themes under the GPL](https://web.archive.org/web/20080113192235/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/04/10/switching-from-creative-commons-to-gpl/). "Despite that I'm just ONE theme designer and despite that I don't contribute directly the WordPress code," he wrote, "I believe that switching to GPL is a step in the direction to support the WordPress team and to help the WordPress theme community grow (positively)." 

The first website to take direct action against sponsored themes was Weblog Tools Collection (WLTC). WLTC was a popular blog at which theme authors could submit a theme. Mark Ghosh, who ran the site, regularly posted about [new theme releases](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/20/wordpress-theme-releases-for-0420/). In April, Mark weighed in on the issue of sponsored themes. While he didn't condemn them outright, he did instate a new policy: 
> all themes with sponsorship links will be labelled as such when they are published, non-sponsored themes will be published first and we require sponsorship disclosure to be made to us when authors make us aware of their new themes. If this disclosure is not provided and the theme has sponsored links, the author will be barred from being able to post their new themes on weblogtoolscollection.com until further notice. 

The [166 comments in the comment thread](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/09/sponsored-themes/#comments) highlighted just how divisive the issue was. The viewpoints ran to both extremes. Many users were unhappy that links where being placed in their websites - this was of particular concern to people whose websites were of a moral or religious bent. While users were happy to have links back to theme authors, they weren’t happy that links for credit cards or flower delivery were being displayed on their website. Theme developers said that it was a way for them to be able to fund themselves creating free themes and were sad to see it being abused.

A few days later, Matt followed Mark's lead and [himself posted on WLTC about the issue of sponsored themes](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/04/12/on-sponsored-themes/). He had [become aware of the trend of including advertising links in themes](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2006-September/008293.html) back in September 2006 when he had downloaded the Barthelme theme from plaintxt.org and it contained a link to New York flower delivery service. For him, the issue came down to three main issues: 
- that sponsored links could negatively impact a user's Trustrank and that the user hadn't made this decision themselves; 
- that theme sponsorship constituted adware; 
- that theme authors who sell links and release it under a creative commons license were on shaky licensing grounds themselves. 

All of these factors meant a negative experience for WordPress users. While the project was supportive of people making money from WordPress-related products and services, it wasn’t supportive of those methods that had a detrimental effect on users. Whatever the original good intentions of sponsored links, they had become so polluted that they undermined the trust that a user had in the software and the community. As a user focused community, the project needed to regain that trust.§

The argument that theme authors deserved to be compensated for their work held little weight when WordPress itself had been built by volunteers for free. There was no opposition from the project to people making money from WordPress, but official WordPress resources should only promote companies and individuals that did so in a way that was in line with the ethos of the project.

Matt closed the post by [linking to a vote on WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/ideas/topic/remove-sponsored-themes-from-wordpressorg) on a proposal to remove sponsored themes from WordPress.org. The discussion on the thread has arguments for and against theme sponsorship; some voted for a complete ban, others for sponsored themes simply to be disclosed, while others felt that it was a theme designers prerogative to include whatever links that they wanted in their theme.

It was clear, however, that whatever the results of the vote, sponsored themes would not be looked upon favourably at WordPress.org, with sites and persons promoting sponsored themes already [banned from the WordPress.org forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/wp-theme-hockey). Even Matt Cutts weighed in with his position, posting on his blog that he [agreed 100% with Matt on sponsored themes](http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/by-the-way-2/).

In July, Mark announced on WLTC that he [would no longer post about sponsored themes](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/07/10/no-sponsored-themes-on-weblogtoolscollection/) and shortly after [Matt announced that all sponsored themes would be removed from themes.WordPress.net](http://ma.tt/2007/07/wltc-high-ground/). Despite a positive reaction from much of the community, there was a backlash, directed particularly towards [Mark](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2007/07/16/turning-the-other-cheek/) and [Matt](http://ma.tt/2007/07/love-and-hate/).

Many theme developers saw theme sponsorship as a valid way of making money, and [were angered at being branded as "unethical"](https://web.archive.org/web/20130523083509/http://www.mandarinmusing.com/2007/07/14/if-i-could-walk-on-water-you%E2%80%99d-complain-i-can%E2%80%99t-swim/), particularly when they saw other theme developers acting in other ways that were unethical; downvoting other developer's themes and employing sock puppetry to upvote their own for example, or stuffing themes with huge numbers of links to their own website.

Despite the banning of sponsored themes on official WordPress resources, the practice of selling links continues today. The Digital Point forums, for example, are filled with [themes available for sponsorship](https://forums.digitalpoint.com/forums/template-sponsorship.128/). It is not without its pitfalls. In 2012, a former theme sponsor [posted on the Webmaster world forums](http://www.webmasterworld.com/google/4445558.htm). He is being penalised by Google for incoming links that are "inorganic": 

> Some 2+ years ago in throws of questionable wisdom I sponsored about 5 or 6 WordPress themes where the "Designed by" link in the footer gets replaced by a link to your site. They were nice looking and "relevant" themes, at least as far as the name and pictures used in design suggest. They were not used much initially and I did not think much of them until these "unnatural links" notices started flying a month ago. Google confirmed that these links were the issue, but with the themes in the wild there wasn't a whole lot that the sponsor could do about it other than contact the websites using the theme and asking them to remove the link. 

Sponsored themes were the first way that people, en masse, tried to make money from WordPress themes. There were people doing custom design and development, but selling links in themes seemed like a valid way of making money, particularly on an internet that abounded with SEO experts and internet marketers on an unremitting search for ways to climb Google's search results. Sponsored themes brought WordPress, not for the first time, into proximity with SEO, both white hat and black hat. Selling links in a theme could easily slide into questionable SEO practices. Besides, it wasn't a business model that was sustainable. With Google the rule-makers, a simple rule change could wipe out an entire market. And as sponsored themes started to disappear from the community, theme designers and developers took their first steps into new ways to make money.
