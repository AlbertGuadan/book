## 28. Premium Themes

From sponsored themes, the theme community moved to premium themes. If theme developers weren’t to sell their links, they could do the next best thing - sell their themes directly to WordPress users. The controversy around sponsored themes had some unintended consequences. When the project removed all sponsored themes from official resources the message "WordPress doesn't support sponsored themes" became "WordPress doesn't want me to make money" or "Automattic doesn't want me making money" When theme designers started to sell their themes they were a priori antagonistic. Some felt that Matt only wanted Automattic to make money from WordPress, and there were times when the attitude in the community verged on conspiratorial. The situation wasn't helped when, in the wake of the sponsored themes debate, [Matt announced a WordPress.com theme marketplace](http://ma.tt/2007/11/wpcom-marketplace-idea/), resulting in [cries of hypocrisy](http://www.blogherald.com/2007/11/01/wordpress-theme-marketplace-hypocrisy-from-matt/). Early work was put into the marketplace, with Automattic contacting theme sellers to ask them to create themes to sell on it. However, Automattic decided not to go ahead with the plan, "it didn't seem right to go into it when we hadn't really worked out all the licensing issues yet," says Matt now. [^Fn-1]

Commercial themes were known for a long time as “premium themes”, with the designation implying that the premium theme was somehow better than its free counterparts. But often the main difference between these themes and free ones was money. Users would download a free theme at no cost, or would pay for a premium one. The designation "premium", however, carried the implication that themes that a user paid money for were _intrinsically better_, as though attaching a price tag somehow elevated premium themes above other, free (and inferior) themes.

The appearance of premium themes implied something lacking in free themes - whether in design or functionality. If users wanted that special something they were going to have to pay for it. But what was [different about premium themes](https://web.archive.org/web/20080121035631/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/09/21/what-makes-a-premium-wordpress-theme/), other than the price tag?

It often seemed that the community wasn't quite sure what made a theme premium. When the question "[What makes a WordPress Theme Premium](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/12/what-makes-a-wordpress-theme-premium/)" was asked on WLTC [there was a large range of responses](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/12/what-makes-a-wordpress-theme-premium/#comments) that included: better documentation and support, less bloggy, better design, better features, better code, more functionality. Or, at least, that's what community members felt premium themes should include. A substantial number of community members maintained that the only difference between free and premium themes was money.

Whatever the feeling in the broader community, designers and developers who were making both free and premium themes distinguished between them according to the time and effort they put into them, and the level of effort required to set them up. In [an interview in June 2008](http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/wordpress/free-vs-premium/), premium theme developer Darren Hoyt talked about the differences between creating a free and a premium theme. He outlines the following considerations for him as a developer: 
- that hand-coding and tweaks to the files should be minimised for the user. As a result he created a custom control panel. 
- as a developer he didn't feel that users should have to download additional functionality in the form of plugins so all of the functionality for the theme was bundled with it. "We tried to make Mimbo Pro more than just a theme or "skin" and more like an application unto itself."
- that best practices with regards to commenting code, valid markup, and well-written CSS be followed. 
- that documentation be provided and evolve. 
- that buyers get ongoing support and interactions with the developer.

Brian Gardner, designer of Revolution, [said in a March 2008 interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20080427183149/http://www.revolutionizeyourblog.com/askthanks.php) that for him what makes a premium theme is how the site looks and acts. When asked what makes a theme premium he answers "if people respond to a site and say 'wow, I can't believe WordPress is behind that,' that's what premium themes are all about."

Although sites like Template Monster sold WordPress themes as early as 2006, it wasn't until 2007 that designers within the WordPress community started to do so. The last quarter of 2007 had the first surge in WordPress premium theme releases. August 2007 saw [Revolution](https://web.archive.org/web/20070825022722/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/the-revolution-begins.htm) from Brian Gardner which one of the first premium WordPress themes, and a few weeks later Tung Do released [Showcase](https://web.archive.org/web/20071016132417/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/09/10/showcase/). Later that year saw [Proximity](http://www.nathanrice.net/blog/premium-wordpress-themes/) from Nathan Rice, Charity Ondriezek's [Cornerstone Theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20080106173642/http://designadaptations.com/notebook/a-cornerstone-to-build-from/#comment-2836), Adii Pienaar's [Premium News Theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20071106033124/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/11/02/the-launch-of-premium-news-theme), and early the following year [Thesis](http://www.pearsonified.com/2008/03/diy-themes-pre-launch.php), from Chris Pearson.[ add something about solostream]

Many of the premium theme sellers started out authoring free WordPress themes, had built up a following, and decided to see if they could make money out of their hobby. None started with the intention to make a career out of it, it was just something they did to make money in their spare time or as a side project while studying at university. Many of them also did independent development for clients at the same time. The idea that selling WordPress themes could be big business didn't cross their minds.  "Even when I quit my job to spend more time working on these themes," says Adii Pienaar, co-founder of WooThemes, "and eventually rebranding and calling that effort WooThemes, I still thought that I was going to build a business around the custom design/development stuff, around consulting."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

From the outset [theme sellers](https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045548/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/how-much-would-you-pay-for-a-premium-theme.htm) were not quite sure how to price and license their themes. At that time, there wasn't yet a consensus in the community about how themes should be licensed and there was no official, legal, stipulation from the WordPress project. As a result, theme authors tended to create their own license. A common approach was that a user would either buy a single-use license, and if they wanted to use it on more websites they could buy more licenses, or a bulk or developer license. As well as restrictions on use, the licenses also restricted what the user could do with the theme. They sometimes, for example, had a requirement that the user retain the author credit in the theme, enabling the authors [to charge for removal of the attribution link](http://diythemes.com/thesis/remove-attribution-link/).

The response from the community varied widely between users, developers, and other community members. The [user who interviewed Brian Gardner](https://web.archive.org/web/20080427183149/http://www.revolutionizeyourblog.com/askthanks.php) was a keen Revolution advocate and it was clear from his enthusiasm that he appreciated the guaranteed support, comfort, safety, and the feeling that he was being looked after. A price tag didn't necessarily equate to these things, but some premium theme developers did a good job of looking after their customers and saw their theme sales continually rise. With WordPress growing in popularity, it was no longer confined to the world of personal blogging. Businesses, particularly small businesses, were using WordPress to build their websites. Paying a small fee for peace of mind was a worthwhile trade-off. When you pay money for a theme you expect to get support. A free theme comes with no guarantees.

Not all theme developers were selling premium themes. Other theme developers were frustrated by premium theme sellers. "'Premium', when it comes to WordPress themes," [writes Ian Stewart in a blog post in 2008](http://themeshaper.com/2008/02/28/the-future-of-premium-wordpress-themes/), "simply means 'it costs money' and not 'of superior quality'." The false dichotomy set up by the "premium" designation was an unintended slur against those who released their themes for free. Justin Tadlock proved that there was [nothing to stop a developer from releasing a fully-featured bells and whistles theme](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/02/24/options-wordpress-theme) for free. He was one of the first to explore an alternative business model, setting up [his own theme club](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/05/31/project-m). In contrast to theme sales, he wanted to create a community around theme releases and support. Later that year he [launched Theme Hybrid](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/08/05/wordpress-theme-club-launch).

It wasn't a clear-cut issue, though there were plenty of community members who thought it was. Some people thought that they could either be involved with the community, or make money out of selling themes or plugins. A wp-hackers thread from March 2008 [asks for feedback on the premium theme concept](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018694.html). The original poster, Glenn Ansley, [says](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018730.html) "I guess it all goes back to what one's primary goal for developing under the WP platform is: money or contribution to the community." Mark Jaquith [was quick to point out](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018792.html) that it wasn't a black and white situation. It's possible to make money with WordPress while still making a positive contribution to the project. Business and open source don’t have to be either/or - the relationship works best when symbiotic. 

In the same thread, Matt outlined how he saw businesses best interacting with the WordPress community: 
> A GPL software community is like the environment. Yes you could make profit building widgets in your widget factory and not pay any heed to the forests you're clearing or the rivers your polluting, but in a few years you're going to start to deplete the commons, and your business and public perception will be in peril. […]
> Contrast that with sustainable development, with giving back to the community that sustains (and ultimately consumes) your services and you have the makings of something that could be around for generations to come.

At that time, he didn't see the premium theme market as commensurate with the community. He [described premium theme sellers as being in](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018780.html) "murky waters" and pointed out that there wasn't much money in the enterprise. In [a conversation with Ptah Dunbar](https://web.archive.org/web/20090625070845/http://ptahdunbar.com/news/wp-news-theme-update-and-matt-mullenwegs-views-on-premium-wordpress-themes), he said that he didn't like where premium WordPress themes were going, that the premium theme market wasn't helping the community to grow.  

Whatever the community thought, users wanted to pay for themes, and companies that sold themes were making money. ThemeForest is a good example. The marketplace doesn't just sell WordPress themes but sells themes and templates for different CMS, as well as HTML Templates. Upon launch in September 2008, ThemeForest sold mostly HTML templates and about 25% of sales were WordPress Themes. By September 2009, WordPress themes made up around 40% of all ThemeForest sales. In 2013, WordPress themes make up around 60% of all sales.

Early discussions and debates often focused whether someone should or should not be making money from WordPress. From those debates a more nuanced question emerged: under what licensing terms should themes be distributed? WordPress itself is licensed under the GPL; the GPL's distribution terms ensure that distributions and modifications of the software carry the same license. This also applies to derivative works, which is where all of the contention lay: is a theme derivative of WordPress? There were arguments for and against on both sides but often the arguments fell into speculation and opinion, much of which was based on interpretations (or second-hand interpretations) of the license. Court cases are rarely fought around the GPL. Those that come close are often settled out of court, as happened with the [Free Software Foundation vs Cisco lawsuit](http://www.fsf.org/news/2008-12-cisco-suit) which was going on at the same as the WordPress community was arguing about the status of WordPress themes. There were arguments, debates, and misinformation, but the community came down into two camps - those who thought themes didn't have to be GPL, and those who thought they did.

There were a number of different factors involved. One was whether WordPress with a theme was an aggregation or a combination. The FAQ for the GPL [distinguishes between the two](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#MereAggregation): an aggregate means putting two programs side by side (like on a hard disc or a CD-ROM). Some who said that themes didn't have to be GPL, said that WordPress with a theme was an aggregate. A theme modified the output of WordPress, but didn't engage with its internals. WordPress core developers, however, stated [that themes use WordPress core internals](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/theme-licensing?replies=22#post-543507). For a theme to be completely independent it would need to use none of WordPress internal functions. 

For those who accepted that the PHP was linked with WordPress in such a way that the theme inherited the GPL, there was still another possibility: distributing with two licenses, what people often refer to as a "split license" or, [what Matt described as](http://themeshaper.com/2008/09/08/the-ethics-of-premium-wordpress-themes/comment-page-1/#comment-8843), "packaging gymnastics". While the PHP in a WordPress theme does work with WordPress internal functions, the CSS, Javascript, and images, do not. Therefore, a theme developer can package their theme with two licenses, one for the PHP and one for the other files. For theme authors concerned about piracy and copyright this protected their intellectual property while ensuring they followed the letter of the GPL. For the project, however, this was simply an evasive game that did an injustice to the spirit of the GPL, i.e. that users be free to do what they wish with the software.

Piracy was a major concern for many theme authors. They didn't like the fact that someone could buy their theme and legally distribute it, and even sell it.  Putting a proprietary license on a theme, however, doesn’t stop people distributing them. Themes from commercial sellers were cropping up on torrent sites all over the web and [being sold on forums such as Digital Point for a cut price](https://web.archive.org/web/20080915174028/http://www.adii.co.za/2008/02/17/pirated-wordpress-themes-get-a-100-theme-for-only-6/). It was easy, if a user wanted, to download a commercial theme for free (though often it came loaded with additional links and malware). 

Other concerns were around making money. How could a business make money selling a product that gave the buyer the right to give it away, or even sell it, themselves? Selling links in themes was banned from official resources and it left theme sellers with two ways to make money: customisation or products. Designers and developers were reluctant distribute with a license that they thought would damage their business.

While Matt suggested that they look into doing custom development, theme sellers were more interested in selling products. It's more immediately obvious how you can scale a business selling products than with services. After all, if you don't factor in support and upgrades, it's possible to sell a digital product ad infinitum, creating a relatively passive income for yourself. Doing custom design or development for clients is restrained by time and resources.

The first theme to be distributed with a [100% GPL license was Revolution](https://web.archive.org/web/20081004003406/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/revolution-going-open-source.htm). Brian Gardner, the theme developer behind it, had fallen upon theme sales like many other theme sellers - he started as a tinkerer, did some contract work doing customisations, started to sell themes, and realised that he could make a business out of it. While developers often came to the project already with knowledge of how an open source project worked, and comfortable with the ethos of selling code, theme sellers came through another route - first they were bloggers, then tinkerers, then designers. Their approach to licensing wasn't that the code should be shared, but that they had to protect their designs. "I and others that were starting to sell themes at that point wanted to protect our work," says Brian now, "we were almost scared of the open source concept where the design and images and the code we felt was all ours and really wasn't derivative of WordPress itself so we sold things on a proprietary level."

What made Brian reconsider, however, was a [comment that Matt left on the theme shaper blog](http://themeshaper.com/2008/09/08/the-ethics-of-premium-wordpress-themes/comment-page-1/#comment-8841):

> I'm happy to give significant promotion to theme designers who stop fighting the license of the platform which enabled their market to exist in the first place, just email me.

This was the encouragement that Brian needed, he emailed Matt to tell him he was interested. He remained cautious and, before making the switch, he [flew out to San Francisco](https://web.archive.org/web/20081002042856/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/meeting-with-matt-mullenweg.htm) with [fellow theme author Jason Schuller](https://web.archive.org/web/20081003091633/http://www.wpelements.com/2008/09/29/from-seattle-to-san-francisco-and-back/), to talk to Toni and Matt. They talked about why theme sellers were using proprietary licenses, and Matt and Toni made it clear that they were happy for theme sellers to make money from themes, but that they wanted them to be GPL. In all of the confusion around the GPL, the message got mixed. Theme sellers thought that they were expected to give their themes away for free.

A few days after the meeting, [Brian announced that from now on Revolution would be GPL](https://web.archive.org/web/20081002153427/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/revolution-going-open-source.htm) and [Jason Schuller followed suit](https://web.archive.org/web/20081004031211/http://www.wpelements.com/2008/10/01/revolution-is-going-open-source-and-im-going-to-join-him/).










[^Fn-1] The theme marketplace didn't launch until 2011, four years after the initial announcement. In the interim, all of those licensing issues were sorted out, but it took the community some difficult debates to get there, and everyone involved had to go through an education.
