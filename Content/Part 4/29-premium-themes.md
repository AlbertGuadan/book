## 29. Premium Themes

In the wake of sponsored themes, theme developers were looking for ways to make money. Some made money from customizations, but increasingly people wanted to make money with WordPress-products rather than with services. Why build one site when you can build one theme and sell it multiple times? If theme developers weren’t to sell their links, they could do the next best thing - sell their themes directly to WordPress users. There was, however, some hesitation around this. When the project removed sponsored themes from official resources the message "WordPress doesn't support sponsored themes" was read as "WordPress doesn't want me to make money" or "Automattic doesn't want me making money.”

Some people felt that Matt only wanted Automattic to make money from WordPress, a situation that wasn't helped when, in the wake of the sponsored themes debate, [Matt announced a WordPress.com theme marketplace](http://ma.tt/2007/11/wpcom-marketplace-idea/), resulting in [cries of hypocrisy](http://www.blogherald.com/2007/11/01/wordpress-theme-marketplace-hypocrisy-from-matt/). Despite putting in the initial groundwork, Automattic decided not to go ahead , "it didn't seem right to go into it when we hadn't really worked out all the licensing issues yet," says Matt now. [^Fn-1]

While the plan for the WordPress.com theme marketplace was put to one side, employees inside Automattic were still interested to see if people would pay for a design for their blog. Noël Jackson ([noel](http://profiles.wordpress.org/noel)), a former Automattic employee, recalls the time when premium WordPress themes started appearing:

> It was interesting, especially in the beginning when it started happening. It was interesting to see revenue figures for themes that were released as a premium theme — not a WordPress.com premium theme — but someone selling their theme and keeping the GPL license and thinking, "Well, people are actually buying this." There wasn't an issue with it. I think that made everybody happy.

Bloggers who used WordPress dabbled around with making themes. They released them for free; “a funny dynamic happened,” recalls Cory Miller, the founder of iThemes, “people started hitting my contact form and saying will you customize this, or will you do this theme, or will you do all that stuff, and I was like I’m, I’m kind of a fraud here. And so I started charging for my work.” This is familiar tale told by many of those who founded the most prominent WordPress businesses today. Many of the people who run those businesses started out simply making themes. Often these were accidental businesses, with accidental business-people, people who came to the community to scratch their own itch and who then found themselves inundated with requests for help, support, and customizations.

Although sites like Template Monster sold WordPress themes as early as 2006, designers within the WordPress community started to do so in 2006. The last quarter of 2007 saw the first surge in WordPress premium theme releases. [Revolution](https://web.archive.org/web/20070825022722/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/the-revolution-begins.htm) from Brian Gardner was launched in August 2007, one of the first premium WordPress themes, and a few weeks later Tung Do released [Showcase](https://web.archive.org/web/20071016132417/http://www.wpdesigner.com/2007/09/10/showcase/). Later that year saw [Proximity](http://www.nathanrice.net/blog/premium-wordpress-themes/) from Nathan Rice, [Solostream](https://web.archive.org/web/20080202093724/http://www.solostream.com/2007/10/28/wordpress-theme-solostream-40/) from Michael Pollock, Charity Ondriezek's [Cornerstone Theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20080106173642/http://designadaptations.com/notebook/a-cornerstone-to-build-from/#comment-2836), Adii Pienaar's [Premium News Theme](https://web.archive.org/web/20071106033124/http://www.adii.co.za/2007/11/02/the-launch-of-premium-news-theme), and early the following year [Thesis](http://www.pearsonified.com/2008/03/diy-themes-pre-launch.php), from Chris Pearson.

Most of the theme vendors followed a similar path to one another: blogger to hobbiest themer. From releasing a free theme to testing the brand new market. Few started career aspirations, it was just a side project to make money in their spare time. Some also did independent development for clients at the same time. The idea that selling WordPress themes could be big business didn't cross their minds.  "Even when I quit my job to spend more time working on these themes," says Adii Pienaar, co-founder of WooThemes, "and eventually rebranding and calling that effort WooThemes, I still thought that I was going to build a business around the custom design/development stuff, around consulting."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    

[Theme sellers](https://web.archive.org/web/20081005045548/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/how-much-would-you-pay-for-a-premium-theme.htm) were unsure how to price and license their themes. There was no community consensus about licensing and nothing clear from the project. Theme authors created their own license. A common model was offering a single use license for use of a theme on one site, and a developer or bulk license, for use on more than one site. These licenses restricted the number of sites a theme could be installed on, and what the user could do with a theme. Some, for example, required that the user retain the author credit in the theme, which enabled the authors [to charge for removal of the attribution link](http://diythemes.com/thesis/remove-attribution-link/).

These commercial themes were often branded as “premium themes” but there was little consensus about what made a theme “premium”.  When the question "[What makes a WordPress Theme Premium](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/12/what-makes-a-wordpress-theme-premium/)" was asked on WLTC [the range of responses](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2008/01/12/what-makes-a-wordpress-theme-premium/#comments) includes: better documentation and support, less bloggy, better design, better features, better code, more functionality. Or, at least, that's what community members felt premium themes should include. A substantial number of community members argued that the only difference between free and premium themes was money.

The “premium theme” label implies that a commercial theme is somehow better than its free counterpart, when often the main difference between them is money. Users download a free theme at no cost, or pay for a premium one. The label "premium", however, implies that themes that a user pays for are _intrinsically better_, as though attaching a price tag somehow elevates premium themes above other, free (and inferior) themes.

For the designers and developers who making both free and premium themes what distinguished them was the time and effort they put into them, and the level of effort required to set them up. In [an interview in June 2008](http://vandelaydesign.com/blog/wordpress/free-vs-premium/), premium theme developer Darren Hoyt talks about the differences between creating a free and a premium theme. He outlines the following considerations for him as a developer: 

- that hand-coding and tweaks to the files should be minimized with the inclusion of a custom control panel. 
- that users shouldn’t have to download plugins so all theme functionality was bundled with it. "We tried to make Mimbo Pro more than just a theme or "skin" and more like an application unto itself."
- that best practices with regards to commenting code, valid markup, and well-written CSS be followed. 
- that documentation be provided and evolve. 
- that buyers get ongoing support and interactions with the developer.

Brian Gardner, designer of Revolution, [said in a March 2008 interview](https://web.archive.org/web/20080427183149/http://www.revolutionizeyourblog.com/askthanks.php) that for him what makes a premium theme is how the site looks and acts. His response to the question of what makes a theme premium is "if people respond to a site and say 'wow, I can't believe WordPress is behind that,' that's what premium themes are all about."

The attitude of the community varied widely between users, developers, and other community members. The [user who interviewed Brian Gardner](https://web.archive.org/web/20080427183149/http://www.revolutionizeyourblog.com/askthanks.php) was a keen advocate of Revolution. He commends the guaranteed support, comfort, safety, and the feeling that he is being looked after. A price tag doesn’t necessarily equate to these things, but some premium theme developers make looking after their customers a priority and their theme sales rise. WordPress was no longer confined to the world of personal blogging. Businesses, particularly small businesses, used WordPress to build their websites. Paying a small fee for peace of mind is a worthwhile trade-off; it brings the promise of ongoing support. A free theme comes with no guarantees.

Some theme developers were frustrated by premium theme sellers. "'Premium', when it comes to WordPress themes," [writes Ian Stewart ([iandstewart](https://profiles.wordpress.org/iandstewart)) in a blog post in 2008](http://themeshaper.com/2008/02/28/the-future-of-premium-wordpress-themes/), "simply means 'it costs money' and not 'of superior quality'." The false dichotomy set up by the "premium" label undervalues themes released for free. Justin Tadlock ([greenshady](https://profiles.wordpress.org/greenshady)) released the options theme to prove that there was [nothing to stop developers releasing a fully-featured bells and whistles theme](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/02/24/options-wordpress-theme) for free. He was one of the first to explore an alternative business model, setting up [his own theme club](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/05/31/project-m). In contrast to theme sales, he wanted to create a community around theme releases and support. Later that year he [launched Theme Hybrid](http://justintadlock.com/archives/2008/08/05/wordpress-theme-club-launch).

The issue of whether someone _should_ be selling themes wasn’t clear-cut. Some thought that they could either be involved with the community, or make money out of selling themes or plugins. A wp-hackers thread from March 2008 [asks for feedback on the premium theme concept](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018694.html). The author or the original email draws the conclusion that either a person can focus on making money or on contributing to the community. Mark Jaquith [points out](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018792.html) that the two aren’t mutually exclusive. It's possible to make money with WordPress while still making a positive contribution to the project. 

In the same thread, Matt outlines how he sees businesses best interacting with the WordPress community: 

> A GPL software community is like the environment. Yes you could make profit building widgets in your widget factory and not pay any heed to the forests you're clearing or the rivers your polluting, but in a few years you're going to start to deplete the commons, and your business and public perception will be in peril. […]
> Contrast that with sustainable development, with giving back to the community that sustains (and ultimately consumes) your services and you have the makings of something that could be around for generations to come.

He didn't see the premium theme market as commensurate with the community. He [describes premium theme sellers as being in](http://lists.wordpress.org/pipermail/wp-hackers/2008-March/018780.html) "murky waters" and points out that there isn’t much money in the enterprise. In [a conversation with Ptah Dunbar](https://web.archive.org/web/20090625070845/http://ptahdunbar.com/news/wp-news-theme-update-and-matt-mullenwegs-views-on-premium-wordpress-themes), he says that he doesn’t like where premium WordPress themes are going, that the premium theme market isn’t helping the community to grow.  

Whatever the perception of the community, users pay for themes, and companies that sell themes make money. The statistics for sales of WordPress themes at ThemeForest show just how they are positioned in overall sales for web design and development products. The marketplace doesn't just sell WordPress themes but sells themes and templates for different CMS, as well as HTML Templates. Upon launch in September 2008, ThemeForest sold mostly HTML templates and about 25% of sales were WordPress Themes. By September 2009, WordPress themes made up around 40% of all ThemeForest sales. In 2013, WordPress themes make up around 60% of all sales.

The discussions weren’t just about whether people should make money from WordPress. A bigger question was, how should themes be licensed? WordPress itself is licensed under the GPL. The GPL's copyleft distribution terms ensure that distributions and modifications of the software carry the same license. Derivative works also carry the license. Is a theme derivative of WordPress? There were arguments for and against, there was speculation and opinion, much of which was based on interpretations (or second-hand interpretations) of the license. Court cases are rarely fought around the GPL. Those that come close are often settled out of court, as happened with the [free software Foundation vs Cisco lawsuit](http://www.fsf.org/news/2008-12-cisco-suit) which was going on at the same as the WordPress community argued about the status of WordPress themes. The community came down into two camps - those who thought themes didn't have to be GPL, and those who thought they did.

There are a number of different factors. One is whether WordPress with a theme is an aggregation or a combination. The FAQ for the GPL [distinguishes between the two](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#MereAggregation): an aggregate means putting two programs side by side (like on a hard disc or a CD-ROM). Some who argued that themes don’t have to be GPL, said that WordPress with a theme is an aggregate. A theme modifies the output of WordPress, but doesn’t necessarily engage with its internals. WordPress core developers, however, stated [that themes use WordPress core internals](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/theme-licensing?replies=22#post-543507). For a theme to be completely independent it would need to use none of WordPress internal functions. 

For those who accepted that the PHP was linked with WordPress in such a way that the theme inherited the GPL, there was still another possibility: distributing with two licenses, what people often refer to as a "split license" or, [what Matt described as](http://themeshaper.com/2008/09/08/the-ethics-of-premium-wordpress-themes/comment-page-1/#comment-8843), "packaging gymnastics". While the PHP in a WordPress theme does work with WordPress internal functions, the CSS, Javascript, and images, do not. Therefore, a theme developer can package their theme with two licenses, one for the PHP and one for the other files. For theme authors concerned about piracy and copyright this protected their intellectual property while ensuring they followed the letter of the GPL. For the project, however, this was simply an evasive game that did an injustice to the spirit of the GPL, i.e. that users be free to do what they wish with the software.

Piracy was a major concern for many theme authors, who were worried that anyone could buy their theme, legally distribute it, and even sell it.  Putting a proprietary license on a theme, however, doesn’t stop people distributing them. Themes from commercial sellers cropped up on torrent sites all over the web and [were sold on forums such as Digital Point for a cut price](https://web.archive.org/web/20080915174028/http://www.adii.co.za/2008/02/17/pirated-wordpress-themes-get-a-100-theme-for-only-6/). It was easy, if a user wanted, to download a commercial theme for free (though often it came loaded with additional links and malware). 

Other fears were around making money. How could a business make money selling a product that gave the buyer the right to give it away, or even sell it, themselves? Designers and developers were reluctant distribute with a license that they thought would damage their business. While Matt suggested that they look into doing custom development, theme sellers were interested in selling products. It's more immediately obvious how you can scale a business selling products than with services. After all, if you don't factor in support and upgrades, it's possible to sell a digital product ad infinitum, creating a relatively passive income for yourself. Doing custom design or development for clients is restrained by time and resources.

The first theme to be distributed with a [100% GPL license was Revolution](https://web.archive.org/web/20081004003406/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/revolution-going-open-source.htm). Brian Gardner, Revolution’s developer, has a typical theme developer story - he started as a tinkerer, did some contract work, started to sell themes, and realized that he could make a business out of it. 

While developers often came to the project with an implicit awareness of the free software and hacker ethos, comfortable with sharing code, theme sellers came through another route - first they were bloggers, then tinkerers, then designers. Their approach to licensing wasn't that the code should be shared, but that they had to protect their designs. "I and others that were starting to sell themes at that point wanted to protect our work," says Brian now, "we were almost scared of the open source concept where the design and images and the code we felt was all ours and really wasn't derivative of WordPress itself so we sold things on a proprietary level."

What made Brian reconsider his approach to licensing was a [comment that Matt left on the theme shaper blog](http://themeshaper.com/2008/09/08/the-ethics-of-premium-wordpress-themes/comment-page-1/#comment-8841):

> I'm happy to give significant promotion to theme designers who stop fighting the license of the platform which enabled their market to exist in the first place, just email me.

This was the encouragement that Brian needed. He emailed Matt to tell him he was interested. Before making the switch, he [flew out to San Francisco](https://web.archive.org/web/20081002042856/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/meeting-with-matt-mullenweg.htm) with [fellow theme author Jason Schuller](https://web.archive.org/web/20081003091633/http://www.wpelements.com/2008/09/29/from-seattle-to-san-francisco-and-back/), to talk to Toni and Matt. During the meeting they discussed why theme sellers were using proprietary licenses, about the fears that they had around piracy. Matt and Toni made plain that they were happy for theme sellers to make money, but that they wanted the themes to be GPL. In all of the confusion around the GPL, the message had become mixed. Theme sellers thought that they were expected to give their themes away for free, not that they were just expected to distribute themes along the same principles of freedom as WordPress.

A few days after the meeting, [Brian announced that from now on Revolution would be GPL](https://web.archive.org/web/20081002153427/http://www.briangardner.com/blog/revolution-going-open-source.htm) and [Jason Schuller followed suit](https://web.archive.org/web/20081004031211/http://www.wpelements.com/2008/10/01/revolution-is-going-open-source-and-im-going-to-join-him/).

In the midst of these debates, themes found a new home on WordPress.org. The theme viewer that had been hosted on themes.wordpress.net [was riddled with problems](https://web.archive.org/web/20080404175227/http://themes.wordpress.net/blog/4421/version-30/#more-4421): themes had security holes, many of them had obfuscated code. The system was continually being gamed, there were duplicate themes, and many contained spam. The theme directory on WordPress.org was set to rectify that, giving theme developers a a place to host their themes and users a place to find good-quality WordPress themes. In July 2008, [the Theme Directory was launched on WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/news/2008/07/theme-directory/), using bbPress (which, at that time, was not a plugin), making it easier than ever to distribute free themes.

<img alt=“the first version of the WordPress theme directory“ src="../../Resources/images/29/theme-directory-2008.jpg" />



[^Fn-1] The theme marketplace didn't launch until 2011, four years after the initial announcement.
