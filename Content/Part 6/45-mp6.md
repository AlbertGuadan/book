## 45. MP6

By 2013, there had been few major changes in the WordPress admin since the Crazyhorse redesign. There had been some changes to the colour scheme but no major redesign. WordPress 3.6 looked mostly the same as WordPress 2.7, apart from some minor changes to the colour. 2013 was the year in which change happened, though this change didn’t only result in a new look WordPress. It also had a big influence on the way that WordPress features were developed. This has continued on into subsequent releases and is now a factor in the way that WordPress is developed. 

In January 2013, [new flat icons were proposed by Ben Dunkle](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23333) and [checked in by Andrew Ozz](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/23369). The WordPress admin looked outdated, particularly on retina displays where the icons looked pixelated. Flat icons would scale properly and also enable designers to colour the icons using CSS. 

The changes kicked off huge discussions about icons, [span off another trac ticket](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23415), and a [long discussion on the UI P2](http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/02/12/discuss-icons/). People were divided on whether they liked the icons. Many people even liked the icons themselves but didn’t feel that they fit with the current admin design in WordPress. Having up-to-date icons only served to show how dated the rest of the admin had become. As consensus couldn’t be reached, Mark, who was release lead at the time, decided not put the changes in WordPress 3.6. It was decided that instead designers who were interested in redesigning the admin would play around with the design in a plugin. The plugin was called [MP6](http://wordpress.org/plugins/mp6/). 	

This design was helmed by Matt Miklic (MT), the designer who had put the original coat of paint on Crazyhorse. Matt opened up a Skype channel and invited MT and Ben Dunkle to join. He asked them to think about how a redesign might work, gave them some parameters, and told them to reimagine the WordPress admin. MT  instinctively felt that the UI research done as part of Crazyhorse ought to be respected, and instead of playing around with the layout and functionality, focused on carrying out an aesthetic refresh.

The MP6 project learned from each major design effort in WordPress, taking the best aspects and trying to avoid the worst. Both Matt and MT were keenly aware of the issues and challenges that had arisen in each design phase. Shuttle, for example, had fallen into the pitfall of being cut off from the rest of the community - a cloistered group of designers who were throwing around comps while slowly losing touch with "the client". There was a lack of accountability which was compounded by the fact that no one person was responsible for overall vision.

These problems were the result of the group's attempt avoid the poor signal-to-noise ratio that can happen whil designing in a free software environment. However, by trying to solve one problem, they created another. The MP6 project took a different approach. It was like Shuttle in that it was a group of designers who were working alongside the main free software project. Instead of a mailing list they had a Skype channel so that they could talk in private, but anyone was allowed to join in. "Even though the group worked in private," says MT, "the door into the group we were working on was open, so if anyone said they were interested they could just walk in." This provided an opportunity for people to participate who were perhaps less comfortable with the chaotic bazaar of the main free software project. It allowed designers to share ideas and receive feedback from one another, without the danger of someone coming out of nowhere and tearing an idea down before it was even fully formed. 

The MP6 project took advantage of WordPress’ plugin architecture. The work was carried out in a plugin hosted in the WordPress plugin directory. Anyone could install the plugin and see the changes in their admin. Every week a release had to be built and released publicly for feedback. Besides this, the group posted a weekly report where anyone could provide feedback. This meant that there were multiple ways for community members to be involved on different levels. It also meant that the group could never steer too far off course. The core team were always aware of what was going on with MP6 and could provide feedback.

There were even more designers involved than there were with Shuttle, with the group eventually growing to around fifteen members. But they avoided the problem of "too many cooks" by having MT lead the team. It was accepted within the group, and within the wider project, that MT had the final say on the design. 

What Happy Cog managed to do was to look at WordPress with a fresh set of eyes. Their distance from the product meant that they were able to treat it as a piece of software, not as something that they were devoted to. They stayed in touch with their client, Matt, but not with the diverse community of WordPress users and all of their thoughts and opinions. MP6 solicited feedback from all of the people with a stake in the project. That brought its own challenges - whose feedback was the most legitimate? What ought to be listened to? When was someone just complaining for the sake of it?

The Crazyhorse project emphasised the importance of in-depth user testing. It's not enough for a designer to make something look pretty - the interface has to be something that users can interact with. If the interface is changes into something people can't use or that they hate, users abandon the software or don’t update. With all of the testing that had gone into Crazyhorse, MT knew that he didn't want to carry out a structural overhaul which would have required extensive testing and data gathering to make sure a change was actually an improvement as opposed to just a change for the sake of it. 

The MP6 project was [announced in March 2013](http://make.wordpress.org/ui/2013/03/09/as-a-continuation-of-the-work-begun-in/). It started out small but grew over the course of the year. The design process began with MT playing around with the CSS. He started out with a unified black L-shaped bar around the top and the side: "that was the idea," he says now, "that the black would feel like a background and the white would feel like the sheet of paper lying on top of it, so it would unify these disparate things." Once the basic visual was put together by MT, the rest of the contributors started refining the design. These changes happened iteratively, and new releases of the plugin were pushed out every week to the rest of the community. The plugin in the directory ensured that the wider community had access to the changes at all times.

There were some challenges to contend with. An issue that caused heated discussion was the [inclusion of web fonts from Google Fonts](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/11/11/open-sans-bundling-vs-linking/). Web fonts are fonts designed specifically for the web. They’re often hosted in a font repository. A designer uses a CSS declaration to connect to the repository and have the font delivered to a website or app. MP6 uses the Open Sans font, which means that the font in WordPress' admin screens is hosted on Google's servers. Whenever a user logs into their admin the fonts are served from Google. Some people don't want to open a connection to Google from their website, and it causes problems for people in whose countries Google is blocked. Bundling them with WordPress, however, requires a huge amount of specialised work to ensure that they work across platforms, browsers, and in different languages. In the end, the decision was made to link to Google and a plugin was created to allow people to switch web fonts off. 

Despite minor hitches, the MP6 project went smoothly. Joen Asmussen, who'd been a part of the Shuttle project eight years earlier says "I would say that MP6 did everything right that Shuttle did wrong." Over the eight years since the first attempt to redesign WordPress’ admin, the project had become more mature. There was more sensitivity to what it takes to run projects within a free software environment. When things are done completely behind closed doors people feel disenfranchised, and yet the bazaar style model doesn’t suit every single aspect of software development. It’s within this tension that a balance needs to be struck, and spaces created that allow ideas to flourish.

The MP6 plugin was merged with WordPress 3.8, released in December 2013, demonstrating that, while it may take a while to get there, harmonious design in a free software  is possible.

	All of this happened as 3.6 rumbled on. Development continued on the core product, development of the feature happened separately. It wasn’t constrained by the release timeline of WordPress. Team working was able to iterate quickly, and users could test it out and provide feedback simply by installing a plugin. This hadn’t been possible before. In order to test out new features in the past, a person would have to be running trunk. By developing the feature as a plugin, a community member could just focus on helping with the sole plugin that they were interested in.	

MP6 was proving to be a success, and in the summer of 2013, it was decided, for the first time, to develop two versions of WordPress simultaneously - 3.7 and 3.8. 3.7 was a platform-focused release led by Andrew Nacin and John Cave. This release was a two month cycle focused on stability and security, while for 3.8 potential new features would be developed as a plugin.	

In a [post on the development blog, Nacin wrote]:	

> This “features as plugins” method* will allow teams to conceptualize, design, and fully develop features before landing them in core. This removes a lot of the risk of a particular feature introducing uncertainty into a release (see also 3.6, 3.5, 3.4 …) and provides ample room for experimentation, testing, and failure. As we’ve seen with MP6, the autonomy given to a feature team can also allow for more rapid development. And in a way, 3.7 provides a bit of a buffer while we get this new process off the ground.

While the project was preparing itself for the merge of the first feature-plugin, MP6 in WordPress 3.8, there was an opportunity to do something talked about for years in WordPress - automatic updates. This was the culmination of years of work. Long been a goal, previously unachievable. For automatic updates to happen, the proper infrastructure needed to be in place on WordPress.org, and the project had to have gained enough trust with the community. Community members okay with their site being changed. 

The data collected by WordPress ever since WordPress 2.3 allows WordPress.org to create personalised automatic updates. WordPress uses the data to make sure that a site only receives an update that is compatible with the version of PHP that it is using, for example, and to make sure that each WordPress site receives an update that works with their settings. In the small number of cases in which there is a failure, the user gets an error message with an email address that they can use to email the core developers who will fix their website. As of late 2014, automatic updates are for point releases only. So while major releases of WordPress are not automatic (3.7, 3.8, etc) point releases are (3.7.1, 3.8.1, for example). This means that security updates and bug fixes can easily be pushed out to all WordPress users. 

Within the space of just two short releases, 3.7 and 3.8, big changes were brought in that transformed the software and the development process. The introduction of automatic updates in WordPress 3.7 means that WordPress users are safer than ever. By December 2013, around 20% of websites were using WordPress and the project has a responsibility to keep those WordPress users and the visitors to their website safe.

3.8 saw the first release in which a feature developed  as a plugin was successfully merged with core. This finally decoupled core development from feature development. So many delays and setbacks in the past had been down to a release being held up by a specific feature. Now, a feature would only be slated for a release if the bulk of the work was already done. It also gave developers more scope for experimentation, and created safe spaces who were nervous of getting involved with core development. A small feature-plugin group is a good introduction to the project in a small, controlled environment. The MP6 admin redesign was [the first plugins proposed under this model](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/23/mp6-3-8-proposal/). Since then, feature-plugins have brought in a new widget customiser, a the new theme experience, and changes to the widget functionality, and experiments are ongoing in image editing, front-end editing, user session management, and menus.
