## 41. The Transition to Release Leads

From late 2011 onwards there was much more experimentation and refinement in the development process. There were various failures in the development process: deadlines were missed, bottlenecks were created, and there was a general lack of accountability. Each release from WordPress 3.4 saw a major change to the development process, and it wasn’t until WordPress 3.7 that these experimentations in process settled down.

The start of this period of experimentation was at the core team meetup in Tybee in December 2011. At that meetup most of the lead developers, committers, and active core developers got together to discuss the project’s issues and roadmap. This was then returned to at the at the [scope setting meeting for WordPress 3.4](https://irclogs.wordpress.org/chanlog.php?channel=wordpress-dev&day=2012-01-04&sort=asc#m349775) on January 4th 2012.

The notes published after the chat cover the [breadth of issues discussed](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/01/05/dev-chat-notes-01042012/). The team acknowledged that there was a problem with process. Jen notes some of the issues: “lack of good time estimation, resource bottlenecks, lack of accountability, unknown/variable time commitments/disappearing devs, overassignment of tasks to some people, reluctance to cut features to meet deadline.” The team proposed a number of changes to help deal with these problems.

The first of these was that feature development be split up into teams, with each team led by a pair of contributors. This was to help get around the problem of community members over-extending themselves. Sometimes it’s a matter of taking on too many projects at once and not being able to complete them, other times life or a job gets in the way and a contributor abandons a WordPress core project.

This pair would ideally comprise a lead or committer with a newer contributor. This would help better engage new contributors. Each team was responsible for posting regular updates and for delivering that feature on time. A schedule was drawn upon with overlapping cycles that encompassed development, UX, and bug fixes. It was hoped that this would prevent bottlenecks.

The other major change was that releases would have a specific focus. 3.3 had been a cluster of disparate features, with some of those features eventually being pulled for not being complete on time. 3.4 was the first cycle to have an overarching theme - appearance/switching themes. This focused the development team on improving both front-end and admin features that adjust a sites’s appearance. 

Between WordPress 3.4 and 3.5 there were also change in the approach to project leadership. These changes were initiated back in WordPress 3.0 when Dion Hulse was added as a committer. When he was given commit access he was not made a lead developer. This was the first step towards decoupling the lead developer position from commit access. Commit access, while being a symbol of trust and responsibility, should not necessarily lead to a person becoming a lead developer. In fact, there needed to be committers who didn’t take on that lead developer role, otherwise it would continue to be difficult to give commit access to individuals. Some might show excellent code leadership skills or be good at triaging patches, but may not be suited for a more general leadership role.

And yet, it wasn’t clear at that time, what the lead developer title actually actually entailed. Different members of the team saw the role differently and no one was on the same page about what the lead developer title meant. For Mark Jaquith, the role of lead developer has changed organically over the years. To begin with, the role was just related to coding. But over time it transitioned, particularly around the growth of WordCamps: "we started going around and talking to users about some of the philosophy behind WordPress and the direction we wanted to take. It became more of a general leadership role in practice." This was born out in the wider community. Often the lead developers would respond to comment threads to address issues, or speak up on behalf of the project.	
			
However, the role was never clarified. While a lot of the coding decisions were delegated from day-to-day to the lead developers, it wasn’t clear what additional responsibilities and authority those with the lead developer title had. Did they have authority across the project? Should they make decisions in areas such as WordCamps, documentation, or theme review?		
		
When the title of lead developer was given to people, it "didn't really have a set of responsibilities assigned with it or expectations,” says Matt. His view of what a lead developer is isn’t the same as some of those who hold the role. For him, the lead developer role sits firmly in leading development, and does not encompass other areas of the project. His belief is that if general authority and responsibility is tied to a development role then it makes it difficult for those who aren’t developers to acquire the same status. 		

This is [ties in with with what Matt said as early as 2005](http://lists.automattic.com/pipermail/wp-hackers/2005-June/001417.html), when he said that commit access does not equate with status in the community. But while it may never have been Matt’s intention to give people with commit access such authority, the very act of giving them commit demonstrated that these were trusted people, and, as such, people naturally looked to them as leaders in the community as well as in the code. Since there was no specific role or responsibility outlined, people simply grew into a more general leadership role.
					
In June 2012, these differences came to a head. WordPress 3.0 onwards had seen a new generation of developers maturing and driving forward much of the development. The difference between the makeup of contributors between the 2010 core meetup in Orland and the 2011 meetup in Tybee was marked. In 2010 just the small team of lead developers along with Jen met up, in 2011 the meetup had new faces including Dion Hulse, Jon Cave, Daryl Koopersmith, and Andrew Nacin.

From time to time, a person comes to the project, gets into their stride, and has a huge impact. In the early days, Ryan Boren became the main driver for WordPress' development, but post-3.0, it was Andrew Nacin. "Nacin like Ryan is one of those guys that just has an ability to get in a flow, and just really crank and get focused intensely, and get through a ton of work," says Matt.

Nacin’s impact on the project grew and between WordPress 3.4 and 3.5, Ryan Boren proposed that since Nacin was driving releases just as much as he, that he deserved the same recognition as the other people lead the project: that Nacin be made a lead developer.

Rather than straightforwardly appoint lead developer, Matt proposed that it was time for an organisational shift in the project. His argument was that the lead developer title was historical and non-meritocratic, that leadership roles should be held by those making an impact in the project today. He wanted to make way for a new generation of developers to take on leadership roles within the project. He suggested that the project move to release leads, with Nacin and Daryl Koopersmith being the first to take the role. This would give clear authority for a single person for a given release, with the release leads having final say, both over the lead developers, and over Matt. For those whose roles were deemed to be "historical and un-meritocratic" it appeared as an attempt to get rid of the old guard to make way for the new. While a number of the lead developers aren’t active in core every day, they are in regular contact with those who work on core, providing advice on architecture and development.

In reflecting upon it now, Matt says that there was a misunderstanding. He says that his intention, in saying that that a lead developer was historical and non-meritocratic, was not to say that the people holding those roles were worthless or irrelevant, but that the roles did not reflect the reality of the project today.

It became clear that there was no consensus about what the lead developer title actually means.  "A source of some of the conflict," says Matt, "is this idea that the lead developers sort of had the same role as me where they had sort of purview over everything across all parts of WordPress." It also brought to a head a lot of dissatisfaction around decision making in the project. Many of those who ran day-to-day development felt that unilateral decisions were made without consultation with the rest of the team. Matt had taken less of an active role in recent years, as Jen and Ryan, supported by the other lead developers, were the main driving forces in the project. And yet decisions were made and announced without consultation. This was a culmination of other issues in core development team and in the wider project: checking in code without consultation, providing feedback only towards the end of a release, and decisions around WordPress.org, the site owned by Matt but that has an impact on the entire community.
	
In response, a number of members of the core team - including lead developers and other team members - sent a group email to Matt to express their discontent with how the project was run. They felt that Matt’s view of the project's organisation, authority, and responsibility, didn’t reflect the realities of the project. While Matt believed that the lead developer role was a code leadership position only, this was not what happened in practice. They proposed that there be an official project leadership team, and that the lead developer title be retained as a meritocratic title for those core developers who had demonstrated leadership, code expertise, who mentored new developers, and who had a strong alignment with WordPress' philosophies. While they happily supported the proposal for release leads, they felt that the decisions for architecture, code, and implementation should rest with the lead developers, and that decisions affecting the project should lie with a leadership team. 
			
In response, those involved scheduled a Google Hangout in which they could discuss all of the issues, air grievances, and make a decision about the best way to move forward. As a result of the hangout, some things changed, and the [first post of the 3.5 release cycle](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/07/11/recognition-and-news-about-the-3-5-cycle/) reflects some of those changes. For one, Nacin was promoted to the lead developer role, and core development adopted release leads with responsibility for an individual release cycle. The role of lead developer remains within the project.

3.5 was the first release following this discussion, and the first release to have dedicated release leads - Nacin and Koop. Following the process set up in WordPress 3.3, they chose a scope for the release: media. Media was an area of WordPress that the development team wanted to tackle for some time but it was a huge task and no one had tackled it yet. As release leads, they decided to finally do it. Koop created a plugin, called [Mosaic](https://wordpress.org/plugins/mosaic/), which was the prototype for the new media management. Much of it was written in Javascript, where Koop’s expertise lay. But as a PHP free software project, there weren’t many others who could help him out. As a result, the two release leads spent between 80 - 100 hours a week working on the release.

While the release itself was well received, and media received the overhaul it needed, the actual development cycle wasn't such a success. It was a huge amount of work, involving lots of feedback, lots of changes to the codebase, and coding a whole new feature from scratch. There were four major iterations to the user interface, including one 72 hours before the release. This meant that the new release leads approach got off to a faltering start. The intention was for release leads to guide and lead a release, not necessarily to spend hours locked away carrying out heroic feats of coding themselves. Once again, the release cycle was driven by focusing on a single feature and the reason it was complete was because two coders broke their backs trying to complete it. But it was the next release cycle, 3.6, that made it clear that it wasn’t the structure of the development team that was broken, but the actual model of developing features for a specific release.
