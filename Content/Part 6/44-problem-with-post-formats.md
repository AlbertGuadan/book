## 44. The Problem with Post Formats

The 3.6 release cycle, a cycle that was beset with its own challenges and that precipitated a new approach to the development process. A number of WordPress release philosophies were at stake. This time _design for the majority_ and, again, _deadlines are not arbitrary_. The process for the 3.6 release cycle followed the contours of a cycle started in WordPress 3.4. There was a unified theme for the release - this time [content editing](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/12/19/wordpress-3-6-cycle/) - and features were assigned to small teams to work on. While this approach adequately divided up the work, it didn’t account for the fact that some features need more research and development than can be achieved within a single development cycle. And it was in the WordPress 3.6 cycle that this became glaringly obvious.

The headline feature for 3.6 was a user interface for Post Formats. [Post Formats](http://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Formats) is a theme feature introduced in WordPress 3.1. It allows theme developers to format posts in different ways. Much in the same way that Tumblr has different types of posts, like quotes or images, theme developers can style types of posts in different ways.	

There wasn’t, however, a standard user interface for Post Formats. In WordPress 3.6, release leads Mark Jaquith and Aaron Campbell decided to tackle the problem. The release cycle was made up of a number of different stages. In the scoping chat, the release lead decided on the features for the release, created teams, and assigned feature leads. Then the feature leads ran their teams, with the release lead coordinating and making the final decision on what went into the release.

Carrying out major changes to the user interface in the space of just a few months is challenging at best. The 3.5 release had demonstrated that in order to get the release done at least within a reasonable space of time from deadline, the release leads needed to put in a heroic effort of coding.

The 3.6 release cycle ran into problems. [Features were dropped](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/02/19/dropping-editorial-flow/) as contributors found they had overstretched themselves and dropped out. The biggest issue, however, was around the Post Formats UI, which used Alex King’s [Post Format’s Admin UI[(http://alexking.org/blog/2011/10/25/wordpress-post-formats-admin-ui) as inspiration. A lot of time and thought was put into trying to figure out the best user interface for Post Formats. How can a user interface be created that has a logical workflow for users, that accurately represents the different actions that users can take, without making the UI or the experience needlessly complex?

The problem with Post Formats was that despite all of the time that was spent on wireframes and development, the team ended up just not liking them. They had come up with the specifications, built to those specifications, and then ended up being unhappy with the final result. “It's like ordering something from the restaurant that sounds great,” says Aaron Campbell, “but as soon as it sits in front of you and you smell it, it's like, "Ahh, definitely not what I was in the mood for." Even during WordPress 3.6 beta community members [experimenting with better approaches to the problem](http://ran.ge/2013/04/11/re-thinking-wordpress-post-format-ui-an-exercise/).	

The target date for releasing WordPress 3.6 was April 29th. On April 23rd, Jen, who had by that point stepped back from her involvement in development, [posted on the core development blog](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/04/23/post-formats-schedules-and-philosophy/), pointing out that Post Formats were not ready, that the user interface was confusing, and pointing to the WordPress philosophy that deadlines are not arbitrary. The thread, in addition to highlighting the flaws in the post formats UI, showed that not everyone in the development team was behind the “deadlines are not arbitrary” claus in WordPress’ philosophy.

> The four month deadline is so fanciful as to be arbitrary. It always has been. Historically, we just can’t do a major release with a marquee UI feature in that time, certainly not without heroic efforts of the 3.5 sort. So we end up facing decisions like this. Every single release we wonder if we have to punt the marquee feature. Punting often requires major surgery that can be as much work as finishing the feature. Punting is demoralizing. Four month releases are empty promises that bring us here.	

In the end, [Mark and Aaron decided to pull the feature](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/05/29/post-formats-ui-is-exiting-core-will-live-as-a-plugin/). A lot of work had to go in to [removing it from core](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/24452). The release was heavily delayed, appearing on 1st August, 2013, three months after the intended release date. 	
Again, a WordPress release had been held up by a user facing feature. Features were always tied to the development cycle, which meant that the time dedicated to features with heavy UI or major architectural changes was restricted by the amount of time scheduled for a release cycle. Just like tagging before it, the Post Formats UI had proved too complex a problem to do within the space of a few months. It isn’t always easy to make interface decisions. it’s harder to iterate on design than on code. 

The solution to this problem was available, and always had been available, within WordPress’ infrastructure. Twice before, core user features had been pulled from plugins into core - Widgets and Menus. Widgets had been built for the WordPress.com audience, turned into a plugin, and brought in to core. Menus had been a problem that had stumped the core development team and they found the solution to their problem elsewhere, in a plugin. In both these cases, design and testing for the feature had taken place long before it got anywhere near core. And as the WordPress 3.6 cycle was dragging on, a small group of designers was working on a new WordPress feature in a plugin.
